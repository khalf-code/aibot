# openclaw patch publish log

## Target

- GitHub repo: `ProgramCaiCai/openclaw-patch`
- Required push mapping: `fix/compact-content-normalize:main`

## Remote checks

- Existing remotes in working repo include:
  - `patch -> git@github.com:ProgramCaiCai/openclaw-patch.git`
  - `patch_https -> https://github.com/ProgramCaiCai/openclaw-patch.git` (temporary troubleshooting remote)
- Remote repository exists and is reachable.

## Push attempts from working repo (failed)

From `/Users/programcaicai/clawd/projects/openclaw`, direct pushes repeatedly failed with the same remote unpack error:

- Error:
  - `remote: fatal: did not receive expected object 1c6b25ddbbeffb51daae43aae85ce01930d9e459`
  - `error: remote unpack failed: index-pack failed`
- Commands tried:
  - `git push patch fix/compact-content-normalize:main`
  - `git push --force-with-lease patch fix/compact-content-normalize:main`
  - `git push --force --no-thin patch fix/compact-content-normalize:main`
  - `git -c push.useThin=false push --force patch fix/compact-content-normalize:main`

Troubleshooting done:

- Verified missing object locally (`git cat-file -t <hash>` initially failed).
- Fetched object from origin (`git fetch origin 1c6b25dd...`) and verified it exists locally afterward.
- Despite that, direct pushes from the original repo still failed with the same remote unpack error.

## Successful publish path (clean clone workaround)

To avoid local pack/object negotiation corruption, a clean clone was used:

1. Cloned `openclaw/openclaw` to:
   - `/Users/programcaicai/clawd/tmp/openclaw-publish-clean`
2. Fetched local source branch from working repo as `localsrc/fix/compact-content-normalize`.
3. Recreated branch `fix/compact-content-normalize` via ordered cherry-picks of the 8 commits:
   - `02288f88e` `621f46689` `19649076b` `ef956011f` `d9bc88c59` `8fce683d0` `8962b5b4a` `4e70e4abb`
4. Added README patch notes commit:
   - `a8559525c docs(readme): add safe_call patch notes`
5. Force-pushed successfully:
   - `git push --force patch fix/compact-content-normalize:main`
   - Output: `16faf31d2..a8559525c  fix/compact-content-normalize -> main`

## Final remote state

- `git ls-remote --heads patch main` now resolves to:
  - `a8559525cf5857c5d22ed96e38696303e03fe44b refs/heads/main`
- `patch/main` includes:
  - `feat(tools): add safe_call wrapper for bounded tool output`
  - `docs(readme): add safe_call patch notes`

## Notes

- Original working branch in `/projects/openclaw` now includes additional documentation commits for this task (`8d7fa14bc docs(openclaw-patch): add safe_call reports and README notes`, `d725709ed docs(openclaw-patch): finalize report files`).
- Publish succeeded using a clean-clone transport workaround due repeated remote unpack failures from the original local repository.
