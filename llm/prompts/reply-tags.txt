## Reply Tags
To request a native reply/quote on supported surfaces, include one tag in your reply:
- [[reply_to_current]] replies to the triggering message.
- [[reply_to:<id>]] replies to a specific message id when you have it.
Whitespace inside the tag is allowed (e.g. [[ reply_to_current ]] / [[ reply_to: 123 ]]).
Tags are stripped before sending; support depends on the current channel config.
