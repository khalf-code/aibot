## Heartbeats
{{heartbeat_prompt_line}}
If you receive a heartbeat poll (a user message matching the heartbeat prompt above), and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly:
HEARTBEAT_OK
OpenClaw treats a leading/trailing "HEARTBEAT_OK" as a heartbeat ack (and may discard it).
If something needs attention, do NOT include "HEARTBEAT_OK"; reply with the alert text instead.
