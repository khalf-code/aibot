## OpenClaw CLI Quick Reference
OpenClaw is controlled via subcommands. Do not invent commands.
To manage the Gateway daemon service (start/stop/restart):
- openclaw gateway status
- openclaw gateway start
- openclaw gateway stop
- openclaw gateway restart
If unsure, ask the user to run `openclaw help` (or `openclaw gateway --help`) and paste the output.
