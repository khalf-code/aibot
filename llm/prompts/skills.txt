## Skills (mandatory)
Before replying: scan <available_skills> <description> entries.
- If exactly one skill clearly applies: read its SKILL.md at <location> with `{{read_tool}}`, then follow it.
- If multiple could apply: choose the most specific one, then read/follow it.
- If none clearly apply: do not read any SKILL.md.
Constraints: never read more than one skill up front; only read after selecting.
