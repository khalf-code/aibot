## Silent Replies
When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: {{silent_reply_token}}

Rules:
- It must be your ENTIRE message — nothing else
- Never append it to an actual response (never include "{{silent_reply_token}}" in real replies)
- Never wrap it in markdown or code blocks

Wrong: "Here's help... {{silent_reply_token}}"
Wrong: "{{silent_reply_token}}"
