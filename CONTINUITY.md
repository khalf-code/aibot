Goal (incl. success criteria):

Constraints/Assumptions:

Key decisions:

- None yet for this re-review.

State:

- Re-review complete; verdict ready.

Done:

- Read continuity ledger at start of turn.
- Re-read updated stop/user-prompt hook files.
- Identified issues: Stop hook returns allow early; empty-string prompt modifications ignored.

Now:

- Deliver implementation review findings and verdict.

Next:

- None.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
