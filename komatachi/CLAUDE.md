# Komatachi

Komatachi is a distillation of OpenClaw—a new codebase built from the ground up that captures OpenClaw's essential functionality while shedding its accumulated complexity, bloat, and historical baggage.

## What This Is

We are not refactoring OpenClaw. We are not editing its files. We are studying OpenClaw to understand:

- What it actually does (the essential behaviors users depend on)
- What hard-won lessons are embedded in its edge cases
- What problems it solved that any replacement must also solve

Then we are building something entirely new—potentially in a different language, with different architecture—that handles the same key responsibilities more simply, more clearly, and more maintainably.

## Why Distillation

OpenClaw has grown through accretion. Features were added incrementally. Edge cases accumulated. Configuration options multiplied. The result is a system that works, but is difficult to understand, audit, and maintain.

The four core functional areas we are distilling:

| Component | Current LOC | Complexity | Key Responsibility |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Context Management | 2,630 | HIGH | Keep conversations within token limits |
| Long-term Memory | 5,713 | HIGH | Persist and recall information semantically |
| Agent Alignment | 4,261 | HIGH | Define agent behavior and capabilities |
| Session Management | 7,319 | HIGH | Track conversation state across interactions |

Total: ~20,000 lines of high-complexity code that could be ~5,000-7,000 lines of clear, auditable code.

## Guiding Principles

See [DISTILLATION.md](./DISTILLATION.md) for the full principles. The key ones:

1. **Preserve the Essential, Remove the Accidental** - Distinguish inherent problem complexity from historical artifacts
2. **Make State Explicit** - No hidden WeakMaps, caches, or scattered registries
3. **Prefer Depth over Breadth** - Fewer concepts, each fully realized
4. **Design for Auditability** - Answer "why did it do X?" without a debugger
5. **Embrace Constraints** - Make decisions instead of adding configuration options
6. **Fail Clearly** - No silent fallbacks that mask problems

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Single embedding provider** - One provider behind a clean interface, not multiple with fallback logic
2. **No plugin hooks for core behavior** - Core behavior is static and predictable
3. **Vector-only search** - Modern embeddings are sufficient; hybrid search adds complexity without proportional value
4. **Cross-agent session access preserved** - This is essential functionality that serves real user needs

## Current Status

See [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) for detailed status. **Read PROGRESS.md first** when starting a new session—it contains context that prevents re-discovering what we already know.

**Update PROGRESS.md before each commit.** This is essential infrastructure for maintaining continuity across sessions.

## Working with This Codebase

When working on Komatachi:

1. **Study OpenClaw as reference** - Read its code to understand what problems it solves
2. **Don't copy-paste** - Understand why code exists, then write something new
3. **Question everything** - "Is this essential, or is it historical accident?"
4. **Document decisions** - Record what we preserved, discarded, and why

The OpenClaw codebase in this repo is our teacher, not our starting point.
