BODY: ## Pull request overview

This PR adds Windows-specific shell guidance to the agent's system prompt to help it use PowerShell syntax and commands when running on Windows. The implementation detects Windows via the runtime OS information and injects appropriate guidance about PowerShell syntax, environment variables, and command alternatives.

**Changes:**
- Added conditional Windows Shell Guidance section to system prompt when running on Windows
- Reformatted multiple sections of system-prompt.ts from template literals to array-based formatting
- Modified .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (appears unrelated to main feature)
