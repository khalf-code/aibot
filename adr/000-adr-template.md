# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a lightweight way to capture architecture decisions as the Clawdbot system evolves so that future contributors understand _why_ things are the way they are.

## Decision

Adopt ADR (Architecture Decision Records) using numbered markdown files in `/adr/`. Each ADR follows this template format.

## Consequences

- Decisions are searchable and version-controlled
- New contributors can understand design rationale
- Superseded decisions remain in the record (marked as such)
