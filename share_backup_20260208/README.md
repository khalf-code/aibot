# Team Shared Workspace

This directory is the central hub for the Claude Code team's collaborative work.

## Structure
- **inbox/**: Incoming requests, briefs, and raw data.
- **outbox/**: Final deliverables, reports, and code artifacts.
- **logs/**: Execution logs from parallel tasks and agents.
- **artifacts/**: Intermediate research data, snapshots, and references.
- **templates/**: Standardized templates for reports, checklists, and plans.

## Rules
1. **Naming**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD_TaskID_Description` for files.
2. **Locking**: Do not edit files locked by another agent (check `*.lock`).
3. **Logs**: Always redirect output to `share/logs/`.
