# PARA & Neurodivergent PKM Knowledge

**Source**: Simon's Second Brain Research v2 (Jan 2026)
**File**: `Neurodivergent Second Brain Research v2.md`
**Purpose**: Executive function prosthetic for neurodivergent minds

## Executive Deficits & PKM Solutions

| Executive Deficit | Neurobiological Basis | PKM Solution |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Working Memory | Decreased functional connectivity in fronto-parietal regions during WM tasks | External capture systems (Inbox) |
| Inhibition Control | Prefrontal cortex dysfunction | "Read Later" buffers, blocking distractions |
| Set Shifting | Cognitive inflexibility linked to dorsolateral PFC | Dashboards with context cues |
| Time Perception | Inadequate hemodynamic response in dlPFC | Visual timers, Start Dates |

**Key Principle**: The Second Brain must be:
- **Resilient to chaos** — Works even when inconsistent
- **Designed for low-friction capture** — <2 seconds
- **Engineered to surface information proactively** — Combats "out of sight, out of mind"

## PARA Method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)

### The Four Pillars

| Category | Definition | Neurotypical | Neurodivergent Adaptation |
|----------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Projects** | Series of tasks with goal + deadline | **Critical**: Break into micro-steps, deadlines required for ADHD activation |
| **Areas** | Spheres of activity, maintained over time | **Danger Zone**: Convert to recurring tasks or Projects (e.g., "30-day Yoga Challenge" vs "Health") |
| **Resources** | Topics/themes of ongoing interest | **Hoarding Risk**: Strict "Distill" rules for autistic users |
| **Archives** | Inactive items | **Clutter Reduction**: Essential for reducing visual/sensory overload in ASD |

### Project vs Area Conundrum

**Problem**: ADHD brains require completion ("Done") but Areas never complete.

**Solution**: Minimize "Areas" folder in daily view. Items in Areas should spawn specific, deadline-driven Projects.

**Dashboard Layer**: Separate storage (PARA) from viewing (Dashboard). Query to surface recently modified items without folder diving.

## CODE Framework

| Stage | Definition | ND Challenge | AI Enhancement |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Capture** | Collection of information | Must be instantaneous (WM decay) | Whisper transcription, auto-save |
| **Organize** | Structuring of information | Risk of over-categorization (ASD) | AI auto-tagging, suggested links |
| **Distill** | Summarization of information | Requires sustained attention (ADHD deficit) | AI summarization on demand |
| **Express** | Creation of value | Blocked by perfectionism, Collector's Fallacy | AI writing assistance |

---

## Zettelkasten (Networked Thought)

### Mechanism
- **Atomic notes** — Single, indivisible ideas linked together
- **Cognitive load reduction** — Lower barrier to entry, allows "micro-productivity"
- **Hyperfocus utilization** — Following links induces flow state (ADHD superpower)

### Risks
- **Collector's Fallacy** — False belief that "collecting" = "acquiring"
- **Maintenance burden** — Deciding how to link requires executive decision-making

**Combat with**: "Just-in-Time" capture rules + Progressive Summarization

---

## Maps of Content (MOCs)

### ACE Framework
| Layer | Function | ADHD Benefit |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Atlas** | High-level overview (30,000ft view) | By topic |
| **Calendar** | Temporal view (What am I doing today?) | By time |
| **Effort** | Project view (What is active?) | By task |

### IMF Mental Model
| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Index** | Single entry point (Home note) | Reduces decision paralysis |
| **Map** | MOCs for topic clusters | Visual navigation matches associative thinking |
| **Folder** | Storage (PARA categories) | Satisfies organizational anxiety |

**For ADHD**: Visual landing page reduces anxiety, provides sense of place
**For Autism**: MOCs allow "soft structure" — note can exist in multiple MOCs simultaneously

## Neurodivergent-Specific Interventions

### 1. Dopamine Menu (Dopamenu)
- **Appetizers**: Low energy (pet dog, drink water, 5 jumping jacks)
- **Entrees**: Medium-High energy (coding, painting, reading)
- **Sides**: Add-ons to boring tasks (podcasts, fidget spinner)
- **Desserts**: High dopamine, low value (social media, video games) — consume sparingly
- **Shutdown Snack**: Small reward after shutdown ritual

**Purpose**: Regulate stimulation, prevent defaulting to unhealthy sources

### 2. Managing Time Blindness
- **Time Horizon Visualization** — Timeline views to grasp interval between "Now" and "Due"
- **Start Dates vs Due Dates** — Tasks starting today are visible; tasks due in 2 weeks are invisible

### 3. Daily Shutdown Ritual (~10 mins)
1. Close all browser tabs (save important ones to "Read Later")
2. Check off completed tasks
3. Identify one "Highlight" for tomorrow
4. Clear physical desk
5. **Shutdown Snack** — planned reward for closure

**Benefit**: Externalizes state of work, allows brain to release information

### 4. Weekly "Lite" Review (20 mins vs 2 hours)
1. Clear Inboxes
2. Review Active Projects (just "Next Actions")
3. Archive completed projects
**Pairing**: Body doubling or reward (takeout) to overcome resistance

### 5. Morning Startup: Launchpad
- Visual cues (hygiene checklist)
- The "Daily 10" — first 10 minutes strictly scripted
- Intention setting — write down one goal for day

## Autism-Specific Considerations

### Weak Central Coherence (WCC)
**Definition**: Strong focus on details/parts, difficulty integrating into global "gist"

**PKM Implications**:
| WCC Characteristic | Challenge | PKM Solution |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Detail focus | May not see overarching themes | Use MOCs to explicitly create "big picture" views |
| Difficulty with gist | Struggle to summarize | Progressive Summarization provides scaffolded extraction |
| Strong pattern recognition | May get lost in connections | Use Graph Views to discover non-obvious connections |
| Extended focus on specifics | Over-detailed notes | Set explicit "atomic note" length limits |

**Leveraging Strengths**:
- Systemizing — Build elaborate tag taxonomies
- Pattern recognition — Use Graph Views
- Attention to detail — Create thorough documentation
- Special interests — Deep dive into PKM methodology

### Sensory Considerations
| Sensory Factor | PKM Impact | Accommodation |
|----------------|------------|---------------|
| Visual overload | Cluttered screens cause distraction | Minimal themes, reduced UI elements, dark mode |
| Color sensitivity | Distracting/uncomfortable colors | Custom themes with muted colors |
| Audio sensitivity | Notification sounds jarring | Silent mode, badge-only notifications |
| Need for predictability | System changes cause anxiety | Lock down structure, avoid constant tweaking |

**Personal Textbook Approach**: Autistic individuals find satisfaction in creating comprehensive reference materials using Structure Notes as chapters.

## AI-Augmented Second Brains (2025)

### AI Support by CODE Stage
| Stage | AI Capability | ND Benefit |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Capture** | Transcription (Whisper, Otter.ai), meeting notes | Eliminates typing friction |
| **Organize** | Auto-tagging, duplicate detection, suggested links | Reduces "where does this go?" decisions |
| **Distill** | On-demand summarization, key point extraction | Bypasses sustained attention requirement |
| **Express** | Writing assistance, ideation, outline generation | Overcomes blank page paralysis |

### AI Workflow Examples

**Task prioritization**:
```
"Based on my tasks due this week and my energy level today (low),
suggest 3 things I should focus on."
```

**Summarization**:
```
"Read this 3000-word article and create a 3-bullet summary
with key insight highlighted."
```

**Connection discovery**:
```
"What notes in my vault relate to 'dopamine regulation'
that I haven't linked yet?"
```

### Cautions for ND AI Use
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-reliance (not learning material) | Use AI summaries as entry points, then engage deeply if important |
| Hallucinated links/facts | Verify AI suggestions before acting |
| New shiny object distraction | Set up AI tools once, then resist constant tweaking |
| Information overload | Be selective about what you ask AI to create |

## Pathologies & Pitfalls

### 1. Tinkering Trap (Procrastivity)
- Spending hours tweaking themes, fonts, plugins instead of doing work
- Solution: Adopt "Minimum Viable System" + "Tinker Time" block (e.g., Sunday afternoon)

### 2. Collector's Fallacy
- Accumulation of unread resources
- Solution: "Just-in-Time" vs "Just-in-Case" — don't save unless relevant to active project

### 3. System Rot & Bankruptcy
- When system inevitably becomes messy, user feels shame and abandons it
- Solution: "Bankruptcy Protocol" — if inbox has 500 items, move all to `Archive_[Date]` and start fresh

## System Elasticity

### Seasons of Productivity
| Energy State | System Mode |
|--------------|-------------|
| **High Energy** | Full PARA, complex tags, detailed notes |
| **Low Energy** | Only Inbox and Daily Note. Ignore rest. |

The system must survive "Low Energy" winter without breaking, ready for "High Energy" spring.

## Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

**Scientific Status (2025)**:
- Up to 70% of adults with ADHD experience heightened emotional sensitivity and rejection-related pain
- RSD is linked to structural differences in amygdala and prefrontal cortex
- Acts as a "causal bridge" between ADHD symptoms and social anxiety

**Design Implications**:
- Avoid red text for overdue items — use neutral colors
- Rename "Overdue" to "Ready for Review"
- Celebrate completions visually (confetti, checkmarks)
- Language matters — a system that "yells" at user will be avoided
