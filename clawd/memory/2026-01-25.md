## 22:00 - Blogwatcher Cron Issue

**Status:** ACTIVE

The `Blogwatcher-Check` cron job (ID: 5b0b7dd4-8ba6-4d9f-98c9-f1ad50aaf188) ran but cannot execute because:

1. `blogwatcher` CLI is not installed
2. Go is not installed (required for `go install github.com/Hyaxia/blogwatcher/cmd/blogwatcher@latest`)

**Next Steps:**
- Simon needs to either:
  - Install blogwatcher (requires Go)
  - Remove/disable the failing cron job
  - Configure alternative RSS monitoring

**Note:** STATUS.md shows blogwatcher as a "bundled skill" but the CLI itself needs manual installation.
