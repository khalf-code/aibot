## Iteration 1 Learningings

### What Worked
- APEX structure (prd-generator + autonomous-loop) provided clear framework
- Starting with market research and success factors grounded ideas
- Categorizing by tier helps focus on best candidates first

### What Needs Improvement (Iteration 2)
- **Pricing validation:** Revenue projections are optimistic, need realistic benchmarks
- **Competitor analysis:** Didn't research existing tools thoroughly
- **Go-to-market strategy:** Ideas lack specific launch channels (where to sell)
- **Risk mitigation:** Need deeper analysis of failure points
- **Validation experiments:** Should suggest MVP tests before building full products

### Gaps in Round 1
- No customer interview plans (how to validate demand)
- No marketing channel strategy (SEO, content, partnerships)
- No technical feasibility analysis (what's actually buildable in 6 weeks)
- No differentiation deep-dive (what makes these unique vs competitors)

---

## Next Steps for Iteration 2

1. **Research competitors** for each top 3 ideas
2. **Add go-to-market strategy** (channels, pricing benchmarks)
3. **Design validation experiments** (how to test demand before building)
4. **Refine revenue projections** with realistic conversion rates
5. **Evaluate technical feasibility** for each idea more deeply
6. **Brainstorm additional ideas** to expand options
