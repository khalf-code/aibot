|----------|-----|-----|------|-------------|
| Template/Asset | $5-10 | $15-50 | $30-100 | $100+/mo |
| SaaS (sub) | $5-15 | $20-40 | $50-150 | $200+/mo |

- **Deployment**: Vercel (free tier to start, upgrade as grows)

**Complexity Assessment:**
- Excel file generation: Medium (ExcelJS well-documented)
- Template library management: Low (JSON storage)
- AI recommendation engine: Medium (requires testing with multiple models)
- LMS connectors: High (Workday/SAP/Cornerstone APIs vary in complexity)
- **Timeline Feasibility**: 9 weeks is realistic with dedicated focus

**Risks:**
- Excel format compatibility across Excel versions (Mac/Windows)
- Large Excel file performance (100K+ rows)
- LMS API rate limits and authentication

### What Needs Improvement (Iteration 3)
