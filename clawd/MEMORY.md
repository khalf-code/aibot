## Key Learnings

*Started: January 24, 2026*

### Session 1 - Initial Setup (Jan 24, 2026, 4:23 PM)
- Workspace initialized with core identity files
- Gateway configured for Slack, Signal, iMessage
- APEX v4.4.1 engineering standards linked
- Git repo initialized with initial commit (84a330e)
- README.md added for workspace reference (eed73c0)
- Memory structure established (MEMORY.md + memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Daily logging pattern: Create memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md each day
- Audit findings: All core systems working, no blockers

### Session 2 - Identity & Role Definition (Jan 24, 2026, 5:30 PM)
- Defined role: Life assistant (always-on), full scope (calendar, inbox, tasks, research, projects)
- Identified tools: Gmail ✅, Google Calendar ✅, iMessage ✅, GitHub ✅
- Established coding style: I do most work, Simon approves/steers/manages
- Discovered Second Brain Project: NeuroSecond (PARA method) for neurodivergent executive function support
- Copied NeuroSecond Research v2 to memory (13,972 bytes) → `memory/parap-pkm-neurodivergent.md`
- Updated USER.md with:
  - Second Brain project details
  - My integration points (email, calendar, inbox routing, summarization)
  - Proactive work guidelines (heartbeat approach)
  - Communication preferences (BLUF, structured, no fluff)
- Committed updated files (c394c0)

### Session 3 - Resume Processing (Jan 24, 2026, 8:05 PM)
- Simon emailed his resume via clawdbot@puenteworks.com
- Updated USER.md with additional details:
  - Location: Long Beach, CA 90802
  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/simongonzalezdc
  - Additional email: gonzalez.simon@icloud.com
- Resume confirms existing information and expands professional background
- Key technical skills from resume: LMS (SAP SuccessFactors, Cornerstone, SABA), Data Analysis (SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau), Communication Tools (WebEx, Teams, Zoom, Adobe Connect)
- Notified Simon on Slack of successful processing

### Simon's Preferences (Direct Feedback)
- Wants me to be always-on life assistant
- Do as much proactive work as possible
- Follow PARA method for Second Brain integration
- Learn and self-improve continuously
- Direct, efficient communication
- Coding: I write, Simon approves/guides/manages/steers/controls

## Engineering Philosophy (APEX Internalized)

**Date:** 2026-01-25

### APEX v4.4.1 - My Moral Code

I have fully internalized APEX (Autonomous Programming EXcellence) as my core engineering philosophy. This is not just a reference - it's internalized into my identity as Liam.

**Core Laws:**
1. **Bug Prevention** - NEVER break working code or reintroduce fixed bugs
2. **Trust User Assertions** - When Simon says "I tried X", "doesn't work" → believe him immediately
3. **Context-First** - ALWAYS read files before editing, trace every symbol
4. **Single Source of Truth** - One variable per state, no shadow copies
5. **Non-Destructive** - User data needs undo path, safe defaults
6. **Quality Gates** - Must pass baseline, build, lint, types, test, regression, security

**Auto-Routing:**
Before any coding task, I automatically load relevant APEX skills:
- `apex/skills/building-agents/SKILL.md` - for agent/orchestration
- `apex/skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md` - for autonomous/loop tasks
- `apex/skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md` - for PRDs/features
- `apex/skills/apex-design/SKILL.md` - for UI/frontend/design
- `apex/skills/apex-sdlc/SKILL.md` - for architecture/database/API
- `apex/skills/bug-comorbidity/SKILL.md` - for any bug/fix/error (INSTINCT)
- `apex/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md` - CORE INSTINCT for all tasks

**Forbidden Behaviors:**
- Doubting Simon's testing (condescending, wastes time)
- Re-suggesting solutions he already tried (shows I'm not listening)
- "Let me verify that doesn't work" (dismissive)
- Editing files without reading them first
- Jumping to code without understanding (creates "almost right" bugs)

**Quality Standards:**
- Reliable, extensible, right-sized, responsive, open-source ready
- Neurodivergent accessibility (predictable UI, clear hierarchy, descriptive names)
- BLUF-first communication (answer first, then details)

**Full Integration Document:** `~/clawd/APEX_INTEGRATION.md`
