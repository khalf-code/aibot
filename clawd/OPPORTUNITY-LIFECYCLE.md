# Opportunity Lifecycle Framework

> **What it is:** A structured approach to tracking and managing opportunities across their entire lifecycle—from discovery to completion to lessons learned.

## Why This Matters

Opportunities come in many forms: job applications, business deals, projects, partnerships, collaborations, new ideas. Without a framework, opportunities fall through the cracks or don't get the attention they deserve.

This framework transforms me from a passive note-taker into an **active opportunity manager**—proactively researching, preparing, monitoring, and capturing learnings for every opportunity Simon encounters.

## The Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Discovery → Identify
**What:** Recognize an opportunity worth tracking

**Triggers:**
- Job interview/application
- Business partnership inquiry
- Project proposal
- Collaboration offer
- New idea with potential

**Action:**
- Ask: "Want me to track this opportunity using the lifecycle framework?"
- Create opportunity record with initial status
- Capture what we know now

### 2. Research → Deep Dive
**What:** Understand the entity, context, and requirements thoroughly

**Research Dimensions:**
- **Who is involved?** (Company, person, organization, size, history)
- **What's the opportunity?** (Role, project, partnership scope)
- **What's required?** (Skills, resources, timeline, deliverables)
- **What's the context?** (Industry trends, competitors, market position)
- **What's the fit?** (Alignment with Simon's goals, skills, priorities)

**Action:**
- Web search for background info
- Review shared documents/materials
- Identify gaps in knowledge
- Summarize key findings

### 3. Prepare → Anticipate
**What:** Proactively prepare for what's next

**Preparation Types:**
- **Interview prep:** Practice questions, research company culture, prepare talking points
- **Proposal prep:** Draft outlines, gather supporting materials, anticipate objections
- **Project prep:** Research dependencies, identify risks, outline milestones
- **Meeting prep:** Agenda, talking points, materials to bring

**Action:**
- Generate relevant questions
- Prepare talking points
- Identify materials needed
- Surface potential risks or blockers

### 4. Monitor → Track Progress
**What:** Watch for signals and respond proactively

**Monitoring Targets:**
- **Email:** Responses, follow-ups, confirmations
- **Calendar:** Scheduled meetings, deadlines
- **Progress:** Application status updates, project milestones
- **External signals:** Company news, industry trends, competitor moves

**Action:**
- Flag urgent communications
- Remind of upcoming deadlines
- Alert to relevant news
- Track status changes

### 5. Document → Capture Learnings
**What:** Record outcomes and insights for future reference

**Document Types:**
- **What happened?** (Outcome: accepted/rejected/ongoing/paused)
- **What worked?** (Successful strategies, strengths, leverage points)
- **What didn't work?** (Pain points, blockers, mismatches)
- **What did we learn?** (Insights, patterns, lessons)
- **What's next?** (Follow-up actions, related opportunities, re-approach timing)

**Action:**
- Record final outcome
- Extract actionable learnings
- Identify patterns to apply to future opportunities
- Archive for reference

## Opportunity Types

### Career Opportunities
- Job applications and interviews
- Freelance gigs
- Consulting engagements
- Speaking opportunities

### Business Opportunities
- Client inquiries
- Partnership proposals
- Investment opportunities
- Product/service collaborations

### Project Opportunities
- New projects (personal or professional)
- Open source contributions
- Community involvement
- Learning/skill development

### Creative Opportunities
- Art shows, exhibitions (ceramics)
- Publishing opportunities
- Collaborations with other creatives
- Teaching/workshop opportunities

## When to Use This Framework

**Use when:**
- Simon interviews for a job
- A business opportunity appears (client, partnership, collaboration)
- Simon expresses interest in a project
- An opportunity has multiple stages and requires follow-through
- Simon says "This is interesting" or "I should pursue this"

**Don't use when:**
- Quick tasks or to-dos (use PARA tasks instead)
- Casual conversations (unless they turn into opportunities)
- Completed/past events (document learnings, don't start tracking)
- Low-interest items Simon explicitly dismisses

## Integration with Existing Systems

| System | Role | Connection |
|--------|------|------------|
| **PARA Tasks** | Execution | Opportunity actions can create PARA tasks |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | Monitoring | Heartbeat checks include opportunity status |
| **Memory** | Learnings | Opportunity outcomes documented in MEMORY.md |
| **Progress Tracking** | Multi-step | Multi-stage opportunities get progress files |

## My Proactive Behavior

**When I discover an opportunity:**
1. Ask if Simon wants me to track it
2. If yes, create opportunity record
3. Begin research immediately (web search, context gathering)
4. Surface findings proactively (don't wait to be asked)

**During monitoring:**
- Check status daily (via heartbeat)
- Flag urgent communications immediately
- Remind of upcoming deadlines/meetings
- Alert to relevant external developments

**After opportunity closes:**
- Document outcome immediately
- Extract 3-5 key learnings
- Update MEMORY.md with patterns discovered
- Ask: "Any follow-up actions or related opportunities?"

## Example: Edison Job Tracker (Reference)

See `/home/liam/clawd/EVOLUTION-QUEUE.md` entry [2026-01-25-018] for a real example of this framework in action.

**What it tracked:**
- Job interview outcome (Jan 23, 2026)
- EDISON company research (size, products, clients)
- Preparation: interview questions, Simon's LMS background
- Monitoring: email for follow-up, application status
- Documentation: interview learnings, alignment with skills

## Framework vs. Task List

| Task List | Opportunity Lifecycle |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "Email follow-up to recruiter" | "Stage: Monitoring → Email: Sent follow-up, awaiting response" |
| "Prepare for interview" | "Stage: Prepare → Research: EDISON company background, questions drafted" |
| "Document interview results" | "Stage: Document → Outcome: Positive, next steps discussed, learnings captured" |

The framework adds context, research, preparation, and learnings—transforming tasks into managed opportunities.
