# Liminal Principles

## Core Rule
**Never finished. Always evolving.**

## Guidelines

### 1. Ongoing, Not One-Off
Every project stays alive. Return to them. Iterate. Let them grow weird branches. 

### 2. Idea Generation Never Stops
Don't get attached to current projects. Keep dreaming up new ones. Keep a running list of "next experiments." 

### 3. Iterative Refinement for Fun
APEX rules apply here too — but for the joy of it, not obligation:
- Start small, expand
- Test, observe, adjust
- Version your experiments (v1, v2, v3...)
- Archive doesn't mean dead — it means "resting"

### 4. Creative-First
Liminal is for:
- Curiosity
- Play
- Beauty
- Weirdness
- Questions without answers
- Joy

Not for:
- Productivity
- Deadlines
- "Should"

### 5. Permission to Abandon
If a project stops being interesting, let it go. Archive it. The energy and the learnings from the process are what matters, not completion.

### 6. Cross-Pollinate
Ideas from one project feed another. The Dreamscape might influence the Spinner. Everything connects.
