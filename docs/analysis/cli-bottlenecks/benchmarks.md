# CLI Benchmarks

## Baseline (2026-02-01)

Measurements taken on macOS (Apple Silicon) using `node openclaw.mjs` to bypass dev-mode build checks.
Environment: Node 24.12.0.

### Results

| Command              | Real (s) | User (s) | Sys (s) | Max RSS (MB) | Notes                   |
| :------------------- | :------- | :------- | :------ | :----------- | :---------------------- |
| `openclaw --version` | 3.26     | 1.61     | 1.17    | 369          | Should be near-instant. |
| `openclaw help`      | 5.10     | 2.65     | 1.81    | 480          | Loads all commands?     |
| `openclaw status`    | 9.48     | 3.02     | 1.94    | 506          | Includes health checks. |

## Verification (2026-02-01) - After Lazy Registry Fix

Measurements taken on macOS (Apple Silicon) using `node openclaw.mjs` after fixing eager imports in `command-registry.ts`.

| Command              | Real (s) | Max RSS (MB) | Delta (s) | Improvement |
| :------------------- | :------- | :----------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| `openclaw --version` | 2.55     | 364          | -0.71s    | ~21%        |
| `openclaw help`      | 3.53     | 463          | -1.57s    | ~30%        |
| `openclaw status`    | 5.72     | 493          | -3.76s    | ~40%        |

### Observations

- **Success**: The "Lazy Registry" refactor combined with the eager import fix has significantly reduced startup time across the board.
- **Help**: `openclaw help` is now 1.5s faster, confirming that we successfully deferred loading of command implementations.
- **Status**: `openclaw status` is nearly 4s faster, validating the "Fast Path" router.

## Automated Regression

A script is available to run these benchmarks consistently:

```bash
./scripts/benchmark-cli-load.sh
```

This script runs against the production build (`dist/`) using `openclaw.mjs` to bypass development overhead.

### Observations

- **High Baseline Latency**: Even `--version` takes >3s, indicating a very heavy initial import graph before any command logic runs.
- **Memory Usage**: RSS is high (~370MB-500MB) for a CLI tool, suggesting large modules are loaded into memory.
- **"Help" Penalty**: The 2s delta between `version` and `help` suggests that constructing the help menu (and likely registering all commands) adds significant overhead.
