title: Deploy on Render
---

Deploy OpenClaw on Render with the official [render-examples/openclaw-render](https://github.com/render-examples/openclaw-render) template and a Render Blueprint. The deployment runs the OpenClaw gateway behind a proxy with token auth and uses a persistent disk. **The source of truth for this flow is [Render's documentation](https://render.com/docs/deploy-openclaw).**

## Prerequisites

- A [Render account](https://dashboard.render.com/register) (signup is free)
- **A payment method on file with Render** — The OpenClaw template uses the **Standard** instance type (the smallest that supports OpenClaw). Render requires a payment method for paid instances; you are only charged for what you use. See [Render's billing](https://dashboard.render.com/billing) and [Deploy for Free](https://render.com/docs/free) for how free vs paid resources work.
- API key(s) for at least one [model provider](/concepts/model-providers) (e.g. Anthropic, OpenAI) to enter when creating the Blueprint

## What you'll deploy

A single Render [web service](https://render.com/docs/web-services) that includes:

- **OpenClaw gateway** — The core AI assistant runtime
- **Proxy server** — Lightweight Go wrapper with token authentication and health checks
- **Persistent disk** — Keeps configuration, sessions, and workspace across deploys

Instance type: **Standard**. See the [Render pricing page](https://render.com/pricing#services) for details.

## Quick checklist

1. [Sign up for Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register) and add a payment method if prompted.
2. Create a repo from the [openclaw-render template](https://github.com/render-examples/openclaw-render) (**Use this template** → **Create a new repository**).
3. In the [Render Dashboard](https://render.com/), click **New** → **Blueprint**, connect that repo, set AI provider env vars, then **Deploy Blueprint**.
4. When the service is live, open its `onrender.com` URL, paste `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` from the service **Environment** into the Gateway Token dialog, then click **Continue** to reach the Control UI.

## 1. Sign up for Render

[Sign up for Render](https://dashboard.render.com/register). Render may ask you to add a payment method when you create paid resources (such as this Standard-instance Blueprint); see [Render's docs on free vs paid usage](https://render.com/docs/free).

## 2. Copy the example template

1. Open the [render-examples/openclaw-render template](https://github.com/render-examples/openclaw-render) on GitHub.
2. Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** (top right).
3. Set options for the new repo and click **Create repository**.

## 3. Create a Render Blueprint

Your new repo has a `render.yaml` that defines the OpenClaw web service and required environment variables.

1. In the [Render Dashboard](https://render.com/), click **New** → **Blueprint**.
2. Connect your GitHub account to Render if you haven't already.
3. Under **Connect a repository**, click **Connect** for the repo you created in step 2.
4. Enter a **Blueprint Name** and confirm the **Branch**.
5. Enter environment variables for the AI providers you plan to use (API keys).
6. Review the Blueprint cost, then click **Deploy Blueprint**. Render runs the initial sync and creates the web service.

## 4. Access the Control UI

1. When the deploy is done, open the web service in the Render Dashboard. Its `onrender.com` URL is at the top.
2. Visit that URL. A dialog will ask for your **Gateway Token**.
3. In the Dashboard, open the service's **Environment** page and copy `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` (it was generated when the Blueprint was first synced).
4. **Your gateway token is a secret.** Don't share it. If it's compromised, change it on the **Environment** page.
5. Paste the token into the **Gateway Token** field and click **Continue**. You'll be redirected to the OpenClaw Control UI.

To connect channels, customize the assistant, and use skills, see the [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/).

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway and Control UI
- Token-protected access via the proxy (no `/setup` wizard in this template)
- Persistent disk so config, credentials, and workspace survive redeploys
- Health checks and logs in the Render Dashboard

## Alternative: Deploy from the main repo

You can deploy from the main [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) repo and its built-in `render.yaml`:

<a
  href="https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer"
>
  Deploy to Render (openclaw/openclaw)
</a>

You'll be prompted for the gateway token (or set it in **Environment** after deploy). Control UI: `https://<service-name>.onrender.com/openclaw`.

## Alternative: Wrapper with installer

Community wrappers can add an install wizard at `/install`, a reverse-proxied Control UI with WebSockets, and export/import for backups. See ecosystem docs for options.

## Understanding the Blueprint

The template (or main repo) `render.yaml` defines the web service, disk, and env vars. Key Blueprint features:

| Feature               | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtime: docker`     | Build from the repo's Dockerfile                           |
| `healthCheckPath`     | Render monitors `/health` and restarts unhealthy instances |
| `sync: false`         | Prompts for secrets during deploy                          |
| `generateValue: true` | Auto-generates a secure value (e.g. gateway token)         |
| `disk`                | Persistent storage across redeploys                        |

## Choosing a plan

| Plan      | Spin-down         | Disk          | Best for                            |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Free      | After 15 min idle | Not available | Testing (no disk; config can reset) |
| Starter   | Never             | 1GB+          | Personal, small teams               |
| Standard+ | Never             | 1GB+          | Production, multiple channels       |

The official template uses **Standard**. To use Free you'd change the plan in your fork (no persistent disk).

## Render Dashboard

- **Logs** — **Dashboard** → your service → **Logs** (build, deploy, runtime).
- **Shell** — **Dashboard** → your service → **Shell**; disk is at `/data`.
- **Environment** — Change env vars (e.g. API keys) under **Environment**; changes trigger a redeploy.

See [Model Providers](/concepts/model-providers) for supported providers and variable names.

## Custom domain

**Dashboard** → your service → **Settings** → **Custom Domains**: add your domain and set DNS (CNAME to `*.onrender.com`). Render provisions TLS.

## Scaling

Vertical: change plan for more CPU/RAM. Horizontal: increase instance count (Standard+); OpenClaw usually only needs vertical scaling.

## Backups and migration

If your deployment has a setup/export endpoint: `https://<your-service>.onrender.com/setup/export`. Otherwise back up the disk (e.g. `/data/.openclaw`) via Shell or your own process.

## Troubleshooting

- **Service won't start** — Check deploy logs. Ensure `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set in **Environment** and `PORT=8080` matches the app.
- **Slow cold starts** — Free tier spins down after 15 minutes; first request can take a minute. Use Starter or Standard for always-on.
- **Data loss after redeploy** — Free tier has no persistent disk. Use a paid plan or export config from `/setup/export` if available.
- **Health check failures** — If `healthCheckPath: /health` is set, the app must return 200 within the timeout. Check that the startup script writes config and starts the gateway with the token.
