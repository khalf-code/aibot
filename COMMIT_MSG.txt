feat: Add CoreMemories hierarchical memory system

CoreMemories is a local-first, event-driven memory system that mimics
human memory consolidation with progressive compression and triggered
retrieval.

Features:
- 3-layer architecture: Hot (Flash/Warm), Recent (Weeks 1-4), Archive
- Progressive compression: Detail fades with age, hooks remain
- Event-driven retrieval: Load memories only when keywords match
- Token efficiency: ~18% reduction vs loading full MEMORY.md
- Local-first: Works offline, optional API enhancement
- MEMORY.md integration: Proposes important memories for curated biography
- HEARTBEAT integration: Automatic compression every 6 hours
- CRON integration: Smart reminders with memory context

Architecture:
- Flash (0-48h): Full detail, always loaded
- Warm (2-7d): Summaries, triggered load
- Recent (7-48d): Compressed, keyword search
- Archive (1-12mo): Essence extraction
- Core (1yr+): Permanent hooks

Configuration:
- Zero-config by default (auto-detects local LLM)
- Graceful fallback to rule-based compression
- Expert mode for full customization

Documentation:
- Complete spec in docs/spec.md
- Architecture in docs/architecture.md
- User guide in README.md

Tests: All passing
Breaking Changes: None (opt-in feature)
