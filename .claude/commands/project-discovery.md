# Auto-Incrementing Repo Archaeology Worker

**Trigger:** `/discovery`
**Description:** Automatically loads the next unprocessed shard from `specs/repo-archaeology-shards.json`, documents it, and increments the counter for the next run.

---

# PHASE 0: SHARD STATE MANAGEMENT (DO THIS FIRST)

Before doing ANY documentation work, you must establish which "Shard" of the repository you are responsible for in this session.

**Step 0.1: Determine Shard Index**
1.  Check for the existence of a file named `.claude/shard_tracker.txt` in the repository root
2.  **If the file does not exist:**
    * Assume the current index is `0`.
    * Create the file and write `1` into it (preparing for the *next* agent run).
3.  **If the file exists:**
    * Read the integer inside. This is your `TARGET_INDEX`.
    * Increment that integer by 1.
    * Overwrite `.claude/shard_tracker.txt` with the new integer.

**Step 0.2: Load Shard Config**
1.  Read `specs/repo-archaeology-shards.json` from the repository root.
2.  Extract the entry at `shards[TARGET_INDEX]`.
3.  **Stop Condition:** If `TARGET_INDEX` is greater than the number of shards in the array, STOP immediately and output: "All shards have been processed. Reset .claude/shard_tracker.txt to 0 to restart."

**Step 0.3: Bootstrap Identity**
Using the data from `shards[TARGET_INDEX]`, adopt the following context:
* **My Role:** `shard.title`
* **My Mission:** `shard.reasoning`
* **My Scope:** `shard.target_paths`

**Step 0.4: Verification**
Output a log line:
> "BOOTSTRAP: Processing Shard #<TARGET_INDEX> (<TITLE>). Next run will process #<NEXT_INDEX>."

---

# PHASE 1: SCOPE ENFORCEMENT

You are now strictly bound by the `target_paths` you just loaded.

1.  **Tunnel Vision:** You are strictly forbidden from analyzing files not listed in your `target_paths` or their direct subdirectories.
2.  **Black Box Dependencies:** If your code imports a module *outside* your `target_paths`, treat it as a 3rd-party library. Document the *interface* but NOT the implementation.
3.  **Deep Detail:** Because your scope is narrow, you must be verbose. Quote code for every assertion.

---

# PHASE 2: THE MASTER INSTRUCTION (REPO ARCHAEOLOGY)

**Execute the following documentation standard strictly within your defined scope:**

## Repo Archaeology → Feature Specs Generator

You are a **staff+ software architect + repo archaeologist**. You have full read access to a Git repository (the “source repo”) and full write access to create markdown documents in this same repo under `specs/`.

Your job is to **identify and describe every major feature and interconnected subsystem** in the repo—especially legacy-framework behavior—and to distill it into a **set of highly structured, cross-linked markdown specs** such that an engineer unfamiliar with the codebase could implement a compatible system (or run an end-to-end test) with minimal additional discovery work.

This is not a generic architecture write-up: it must be grounded in what the repo actually does, how it does it, and where those behaviors live in code.

---

### Mission and scope

#### Primary goal (first pass)
Produce a complete, navigable spec set that covers:

- **All interconnected pieces**
- **The abstraction + data layer** (schemas/models/contracts)
- **Tools system** and **Connectors/Channels**
- **Agentic loop behavior** (planning/execution/stop conditions/tool-call cycles)
- **All eventing**: event bus, hooks/callbacks, webhooks, websockets, message streams
- **Runtime layer isolation**:
  - implementation layer: agent/gateway/core services
  - interaction layer: UI/TUI/Webhook/Channel integrations
- **End-to-end minimal run**: enough contract wiring + minimal implementation guidance to run an E2E test with *minimal config + minimal code*, **including**:
  - Channel/Connector abstraction
  - Config mechanism
  - A working **Slack Channel implementation** (the only required concrete channel for this pass)
- **Model Provider abstraction** (foundation interface + facade)
  - Must support **3 providers** at an interface/contract level and include how tool/function calling is handled:
    1) OpenAI (API-based)
    2) OpenRouter (API-based)
    3) Anthropic via **Claude Agent SDK route** (NOT conventional API endpoint; must support *z.AI* and *Claude Code Max* subscription-style usage through the SDK/agent route)
- **Cron scheduling wiring**
  - You do **not** need to implement full cron persistence/management.
  - You **must** define **schemas/data structures**, interface contracts, and integration points with the rest of the system.
  - Add unit-testable seams and specify contract tests.

#### Additional mandatory deliverables (future divergence docs)
While reviewing the repo, also create *separate* markdown docs under `specs/future/*.md` that propose how we will extend/diverge from this repository for the following future features:

- MCP Tools: first-class support in the Agentic Pipeline
- Gateway/API exposes MCP Tools (SSE/HTTPS), and how to surface Tool suggestions
- Hierarchical/Structured Tasks associated with Agents + Sessions (Session sees both its own tasks and agent-level tasks)
- Goals as a first-class concept
- Guardrails: pluggable mechanisms and interface contracts at key points in the flow
- Prompt injection protection: identify high-risk current spots, and evaluate whether guardrails are sufficient
- Data provenance: schema + integration points (stubbed in first pass)
- Decision rationale / decision provenance: breadcrumbing major steps; schema + conceptual structure now (integration later)
- Multi-tenant considerations:
  - The current repo is single-tenant.
  - Do **not** implement multi-tenancy in first pass.
  - Do **not** include multi-tenancy in the main design docs or plans.
  - **Do** produce a separate future doc listing feasibility concerns and areas to consider for eventual multi-tenant evolution.
- Auditing and event history (separate from eventing/hooks/callbacks; likely implemented by subscribing to emitted events)

#### Final consolidation deliverable
Create `specs/README.md` that provides:
- A **high-level breakdown** of all major interfaces/data models/services
- A **link index** to all detailed feature specs you wrote
- A **comprehensive proposal** for:
  - module boundaries and project structure
  - frameworks/tech stack (we will be revamping config UI with **React + Shadcn/Radix**, plus product-specific reusable components/panels)
  - deployment approach (containerized, K8s/ECS/GCS-friendly)
- It’s OK to recommend additional dependencies beyond the current repo.

---

### Rules: accuracy and completeness

#### Ground everything in the repo
- **Do not invent** behavior.
- Every key claim must be backed by:
  - file paths, symbols, config keys, data model definitions, or test evidence.
- When you infer behavior, label it clearly as an inference and list what would confirm it.

#### No major features missed: enforce completeness
You must prove coverage by doing all of the following:
1) **Repo census**: enumerate major directories/modules/packages and their roles.
2) **Entrypoint tracing**: identify all runtime entrypoints (server, worker, cli, scheduler, UI) and trace flows.
3) **Pattern scans** (ripgrep/grep equivalents): search for common feature indicators (events/hooks/tools/providers/channels/sessions/etc.).
4) **Coverage matrix**: maintain a table mapping “repo area → spec doc link”.
5) **Cross-linking**: each spec doc must link to related specs and be linked from `specs/README.md`.

---

### Output structure and file organization (MANDATORY)

All outputs are markdown files in the repo.

#### Required directory structure
- `specs/<feature>/*.md` — main feature specs (multiple docs per feature allowed/expected)
- `specs/future/*.md` — future divergence/extension docs (listed above)
- `specs/README.md` — final consolidated index + module/stack proposal

#### Naming conventions
- Use `kebab-case` for folders and files.
- Each `specs/<feature>/` directory should represent a cohesive bounded area.
- Prefer “one topic per file”; split when a file would exceed ~200–300 lines.

#### Required “frontmatter block” in every spec file
At the top of every `specs/**.md` file include:

```md
---
status: draft
scope: [as-is, first-pass, future-notes]   # choose what applies
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
source_paths:
  - path/to/primary/files
search_terms:
  - "terms you used to find this"
related_specs:
  - ../some/other/spec.md
---

```

Keep `source_paths` real and useful.

---

### Required content template for each feature spec

Every feature spec must include these sections (in this order), unless not applicable:

1. **Purpose**
* What problem the feature solves
* Who uses it (system/user/agent/service)


2. **As-Is behavior (from repo)**
* Key flows and invariants
* Where the logic lives (file paths + symbols)
* What’s legacy/quirky about it


3. **Key abstractions and contracts**
* Interfaces / base classes / protocols
* Expected inputs/outputs and lifecycle
* Extension points (plugins, registries, adapters)


4. **Data model and schema**
* Entities, identifiers, relationships
* Persistence approach (DB/kv/files/in-memory)
* Include JSON-schema-ish blocks or SQL-ish pseudo tables when helpful


5. **Runtime lifecycle**
* Initialization, steady-state, shutdown
* Concurrency model (threads/async/queues)
* Error handling and retries


6. **Eventing**
* Events emitted/consumed (names + payload schema)
* Hooks/callbacks and where they attach
* Webhooks/websockets/SSE schemas if applicable


7. **Configuration**
* Config sources (env/files/DB)
* Exact config keys and defaults
* “Minimal config for E2E” section if relevant


8. **End-to-end flow diagram**
* Include at least one **Mermaid** diagram (sequence or component)
* Example:
* user message → channel → gateway → agent loop → model provider → tool calls → response




9. **Testing notes**
* Existing tests (where + what they cover)
* Gaps and **contract tests** needed for first-pass wiring


10. **First-pass implementation notes**

* What must be real in first pass vs stubbed
* Integration points that must exist now

11. **Open questions / TODOs**

---

### Required “feature areas” to cover (minimum set)

You must create spec docs covering at least these areas (as separate feature directories), *even if you discover the repo implements them differently*:

1. `specs/architecture/`
* overall system map, module boundaries (as-is)
* repo inventory/census


2. `specs/config/`
* configuration mechanism, layering, validation, secrets


3. `specs/data/`
* data abstraction layer, schemas, persistence contracts


4. `specs/runtime/`
* sessions isolation
* agents (definitions/config)
* consider **AgentTemplate** + Clone concept (include analysis + recommendation)
* agentic loop (planning/execution/tool call cycles/termination)


5. `specs/tools/`
* tool abstraction/registry/execution
* tool calling/function calling end-to-end


6. `specs/channels/`
* channel/connector abstraction (fundamental interface)
* **Slack channel implementation** (required in first pass)


7. `specs/providers/`
* provider interface abstraction + facade
* OpenAI provider mapping
* OpenRouter provider mapping
* Anthropic **Claude Agent SDK route** mapping
* tool calling/function calling differences normalized by the facade


8. `specs/events/`
* events/hooks/callbacks
* webhooks
* websocket/SSE schema and patterns (if used)


9. `specs/gateway/`
* API/gateway responsibilities and boundaries vs agent runtime


10. `specs/scheduler/`

* cron schedule schema + integration contracts

11. `specs/ui/`

* current interaction layer (UI/TUI/etc) as-is
* proposed **React + Shadcn/Radix** architecture, reusable panels/subviews, minimal complexity

12. `specs/deployment/`

* containerized mode requirements: explicit host isolation
* K8s/ECS/GCS deployment considerations

13. `specs/testing/`

* minimal end-to-end test plan with minimal config
* unit/contract test seams for cron + providers + slack channel + tool loop

If the repo has additional major subsystems (auth, billing, permissions, indexing, retrieval, vector DB, etc.), add more feature directories.

---

### Required future docs (create exactly these files)

Create these under `specs/future/`:

* `specs/future/mcp-tools.md`
* `specs/future/mcp-gateway-exposure.md`
* `specs/future/tasks.md`
* `specs/future/goals.md`
* `specs/future/guardrails.md`
* `specs/future/prompt-injection.md`
* `specs/future/data-provenance.md`
* `specs/future/decision-provenance.md`
* `specs/future/multi-tenancy-considerations.md`
* `specs/future/auditing-event-history.md`

Each future doc must include:

* What exists in the repo that is adjacent/relevant (paths/symbols)
* Proposed integration points (where in the flow)
* Minimal schema/contracts now vs later
* Risks and open questions

Multi-tenancy doc must be *concerns only* (no mainline design changes).

---

### Work plan (do this in order)

#### Phase 1 — Repo census (prove you looked everywhere)

Produce `specs/architecture/repo-inventory.md` including:

* language(s), frameworks, build tools
* top-level directories and purpose
* runtime entrypoints
* config sources
* data stores
* external integrations
* test layout

Also produce `specs/architecture/system-map.md`:

* component diagram (Mermaid)
* key module boundaries and interactions

#### Phase 2 — Feature discovery (don’t miss anything)

Perform systematic scans and record your search terms in each spec’s frontmatter.
At minimum search for:

* `agent`, `session`, `conversation`, `thread`, `memory`
* `tool`, `function`, `schema`, `registry`, `plugin`
* `channel`, `connector`, `adapter`, `slack`
* `provider`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `claude`, `openrouter`
* `event`, `emit`, `subscribe`, `hook`, `callback`
* `webhook`, `websocket`, `sse`, `stream`
* `cron`, `schedule`, `job`, `queue`, `worker`
* `config`, `env`, `dotenv`, `yaml`, `json`, `toml`
* `docker`, `k8s`, `helm`, `ecs`, `gke`, `container`

Create `specs/architecture/coverage-matrix.md` as a living table:
| Repo Area / Concern | Key paths | Spec doc(s) | Notes / Gaps |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
Update it continuously.

#### Phase 3 — Write feature specs (as-is + first-pass)

For each required feature area, create the directory and write the docs using the template above.
Mandatory emphasis:

* agentic loop + tool calling + provider abstraction + slack channel + cron wiring
* session isolation + agent configs + agent template/clone analysis
* eventing + webhooks/websockets patterns
* containerized deployment constraints

#### Phase 4 — Future divergence docs

Write each `specs/future/*.md` doc listed above.

#### Phase 5 — Final consolidation README

Complete `specs/README.md` with:

* high-level overview
* link index to every spec
* module breakdown proposal and tech stack recommendation:
* React + Shadcn/Radix for config UI
* define reusable panel/subview patterns
* backend stack recommendation grounded in repo realities
* container-first deployment guidance (K8s/ECS/GCS)


* “Minimal E2E path” section:
* minimal config required
* slack channel path
* a minimal agent + session run flow
* how tool calls happen
* what unit/contract tests validate cron/provider/channel integration points



---

### Special requirements (must satisfy)

#### Model Provider facade + tool/function calling normalization

In `specs/providers/` you must explain:

* the provider interface and lifecycle
* how tool schemas are represented
* how tool calls are detected, validated, invoked, and returned
* streaming vs non-streaming considerations
* differences between OpenAI/OpenRouter/Anthropic Claude Agent SDK route and how the facade hides them

#### Cron schedule wiring (contract-level)

In `specs/scheduler/cron.md` you must include:

* cron schedule entity schema
* scheduling triggers and how they enqueue/execute work
* integration points with sessions/agents/tools/events
* persistence left stubbed, but contracts must be unit-testable

#### Sessions and Agents

In `specs/runtime/` you must include:

* session identity, isolation boundaries, concurrency
* per-agent configuration inheritance/overrides
* recommendation: AgentTemplate + Clone (or justify not doing it)
* how sessions access tasks (future note), and how agent-level artifacts relate

#### Eventing and interaction-layer isolation

In `specs/events/` and `specs/gateway/` cover:

* event schemas
* callbacks/hooks
* webhooks and websocket patterns and payload schemas
* boundary between:
* core runtime (agent/gateway/services)
* interaction layer (UI/TUI/webhooks/channels)



#### Containerization and deployment

In `specs/deployment/` include:

* explicit host isolation requirements
* secret/config injection patterns
* K8s/ECS/GCS notes (health checks, scaling, volumes, networking)

---

### Definition of Done checklist (must pass before finishing)

* [ ] `specs/README.md` exists and links to **every** spec file you created
* [ ] All required feature directories exist and are populated
* [ ] All required `specs/future/*.md` files exist and are populated
* [ ] `specs/architecture/coverage-matrix.md` exists and has no “major directory unassigned”
* [ ] Each spec has frontmatter with real `source_paths` and `search_terms`
* [ ] Agentic loop, tool system, slack channel, provider facade, cron wiring are documented deeply enough to implement compatible stubs
* [ ] Each major flow includes at least one Mermaid diagram
* [ ] Any uncertainty is explicitly labeled with TODO + the exact code location to confirm
