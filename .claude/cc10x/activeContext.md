## Current Focus

Finding a way to build the Android app on ARM64 system.

## Recent Changes

- [DEBUG-1]: Attempted direct ./gradlew build → Failed: AAPT2 binaries are x86-64, system is aarch64
- [DEBUG-2]: Investigated Docker alternative → Ubuntu images run as ARM64, but Android SDK binaries would still be x86-64
- [DEBUG-3]: Checked for ARM64 Android SDK → Not found in /usr/lib/android-sdk
- [SOLUTION]: Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/android-build.yml) for remote CI builds

## Next Steps

Test GitHub Actions workflow by pushing to repository.

## Decisions

- Use GitHub Actions CI for Android builds instead of local ARM64 build
- Simplifies build process - no local SDK installation needed
- Leverages GitHub's x86-64 runners automatically

## Learnings

- System architecture: aarch64 (ARM64)
- Android SDK tools (AAPT2) are x86-64 binaries
- Google doesn't provide ARM64 Android SDK command-line tools
- Docker containers inherit host architecture (ARM64 on ARM64)

- Plan: N/A
- Design: N/A
- Research: N/A

## Blockers

- None resolved (workaround: GitHub Actions CI)
