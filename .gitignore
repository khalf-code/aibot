# Guiding documents (workspace/*.md, workspace/projects/*/CHARTER.md, etc.)
# are TRACKED - they define the agent's operating system.
# Runtime artifacts generated by the agent are IGNORED below.

# Runtime logs (generated by audit-logger, conflict detection, alerts)
# Ignore contents but keep directory structure via .gitkeep
workspace/logs/**/*.md
workspace/logs/**/*.json
workspace/logs/**/*.jsonl

# Daily memory files (generated by agent during sessions)
workspace/memory/*.md

# Project research artifacts (generated during investigation)
workspace/projects/*/research/**

# Project source code (lives in its own repo or deployment target)
