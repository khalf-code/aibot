BODY: The Windows shell guidance feature lacks test coverage. Consider adding a test case in `system-prompt.test.ts` to verify that the Windows-specific guidance is included when `runtimeInfo.os` contains "windows" and excluded otherwise. This would ensure the feature works as expected and prevent regressions.

For example, you could add a test like:
- Test that when runtimeInfo.os includes "Windows_NT", the prompt contains "## Windows Shell Guidance"
- Test that when runtimeInfo.os is "Darwin" or "Linux", this section is not included

BODY: This PR includes extensive indentation/formatting changes throughout the file that are not mentioned in the PR description. While these changes appear to be consistent reformatting (switching from multi-line template literals to array-based formatting), they make it harder to review the actual functional change (the Windows guidance addition). Consider:

1. Splitting formatting changes into a separate commit/PR, OR
2. Explicitly mentioning these formatting changes in the PR description

This follows best practices for keeping functional changes separate from style/formatting changes for easier code review and git history.

BODY: The Windows guidance warns against using Unix commands like `grep`, but the system prompt (lines 340-342) also lists `grep`, `find`, and `ls` as Pi's standard tools. This could be confusing because:

1. Pi provides `grep`, `find`, and `ls` as built-in tools that work cross-platform
2. The Windows guidance seems to warn against using these names in shell commands via the `exec` tool

Consider clarifying this distinction in the Windows guidance. For example: "- Do NOT use Unix commands like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `head`, `tail` in exec/shell commands unless you are sure they are installed (Pi's built-in grep/find/ls tools work fine)."

This makes it clear that the warning is specifically about shell commands, not Pi's built-in tools.
```suggestion
        "- Do NOT use Unix commands like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `head`, `tail` in exec/shell (PowerShell) commands unless you are sure they are installed. Pi's built-in tools named `grep`, `find`, and `ls` are safe to use.",

LINE: 315
BODY: The PR includes changes to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` which is unrelated to adding Windows PowerShell support. The diff shows the entire file (315 lines) as new additions, which suggests either:

1. The file was regenerated/reformatted
2. Line ending changes (CRLF Γåö LF)
3. The file was accidentally included in this PR

Since this is unrelated to the stated PR purpose ("add windows powershell support to system prompt"), consider:
- Removing this file from the PR if it was accidentally included
- If intentional, explain the reason in the PR description
- If it's a line ending change, consider using `.gitattributes` to enforce consistent line endings

Including unrelated changes makes code review more difficult and complicates the git history.
