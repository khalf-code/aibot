# ⚠️ DEPRECATED — DO NOT MODIFY ⚠️

This `ui/` directory contains the **legacy upstream UI** and is **NOT used in our fork**.

## Where to work instead

All UI development happens in: **`apps/web/`**

```
/Users/dgarson/clawd/clawdbot/apps/web/
```

This is our revamped UI built with:
- React
- TanStack Router
- shadcn/ui components
- Modern tooling

## Why this is deprecated

The upstream `ui/` directory:
- Is maintained by the community for the original OpenClaw project
- Has different design goals than our fork
- Contributions upstream are difficult to merge
- Is not aligned with our product vision

## What to do if you land here by mistake

1. **STOP** — do not make changes here
2. Navigate to `apps/web/` instead
3. If a task mentions "UI" or "web interface", it means `apps/web/`
