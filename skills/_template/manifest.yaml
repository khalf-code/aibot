# Skill Manifest (v1)
#
# This file declares metadata and permissions for your skill.
# The Clawdbot runtime reads this manifest to enforce sandboxing,
# tool access, and approval gates.
#
# Copy this template, then replace every value below.
# Delete comments once you understand each field.

# ── Identity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# name:
#   Must match the skill directory name exactly.
#   Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only.
#   Examples: enrich-lead-website, format-invoice, check-dns
name: my-skill

# version:
#   Semantic version. Start at 1.0.0.
#   Bump the minor version for new features, patch for fixes.
version: 1.0.0

# description:
#   One clear sentence explaining what this skill does.
#   Be specific -- this is used for skill discovery and triggering.
#   Good:  "Scrape a lead's website and extract company name, tagline, and key pages."
#   Bad:   "Does website stuff."

# ── Permissions ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Permissions are enforced by the runtime. Declare only what your
# skill actually needs. Less is better.

permissions:
  # tools:
  #   Which tool runners this skill can use.
  #   Common values:
  #     - cli-runner        # Execute allowlisted shell commands
  #     - browser-runner    # Playwright-based web automation
  #     - email-runner      # Send or read emails
  #   Leave empty ([]) if your skill only does in-process computation.
  tools: []

  # secrets:
  #   Secret names your skill reads from the vault at runtime.
  #   Examples: OPENAI_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  #   Leave empty ([]) if no external API keys are needed.
  secrets: []

  # domains:
  #   Which internet domains the skill can access.
  #   Use "*" for unrestricted access (avoid when possible).
  #   Use specific domains for tighter security:
  #     - "api.example.com"
  #     - "*.github.com"
  #   Leave empty ([]) if the skill does not make network requests.
  domains: []

# ── Behavior ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# approval_required:
#   Set to true if this skill performs "commit-step" actions:
#   sending emails, submitting forms, making payments, calling
#   external services with side effects, or deleting data.
#   When true, the runtime pauses for human approval before execution.
#   Read-only or computation-only skills should use false.
approval_required: false

# timeout_ms:
#   Maximum execution time in milliseconds.
#   The runtime kills the skill if it exceeds this limit.
#   Recommended ranges:
#     - Simple computation: 5000-10000   (5-10 seconds)
#     - API calls:          15000-30000  (15-30 seconds)
#     - Browser automation: 30000-60000  (30-60 seconds)
#   Default: 30000
timeout_ms: 30000
