# Garmin Connect

```bash

```

This will:
1. Install `garminconnect` Python package
2. Prompt for Garmin credentials (stored securely in `~/.garminconnect`)
3. Tokens are valid for ~1 year

## Commands

## Output Formats

All commands support JSON output for programmatic use:

```

## Credentials

Credentials are fetched in this order:
1. **Saved tokens** in `~/.garminconnect/` (valid ~1 year)
2. **Bitwarden CLI** - searches for "garmin" entry (must be unlocked)
3. **Interactive prompt** (last resort)

### Using Bitwarden

If you have Bitwarden CLI installed and unlocked, credentials are automatic:

```bash
bw unlock                    # Unlock vault first
export BW_SESSION="..."      # Set session from unlock output
{baseDir}/scripts/garmin.py status   # Auto-fetches from Bitwarden
```

### Re-authenticate

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/garmin.py login
```
