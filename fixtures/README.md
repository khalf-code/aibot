# Test Data Fixtures

Shared, realistic test data for use across unit tests, integration tests, and development workflows. All data uses obviously fake identities (Acme Corp, Jane Doe, etc.) and `.example.com` domains -- never commit real PII or credentials here.

## Directory Structure

```
fixtures/
  emails/            Sample email fixtures (plain text and HTML)
  web-pages/         Sample HTML pages for scraping/parsing tests
  csv/               Tabular data files (contacts, invoices, catalogs)
  api-responses/     JSON payloads representing external API responses
```

## Usage in Tests

Import fixtures by path relative to the repo root. With Vitest (the project test runner), you can read fixtures using Node's `fs` module or a helper:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { resolve } from "node:path";

// Read a JSON fixture
const crmLead = JSON.parse(
  readFileSync(resolve(__dirname, "../../fixtures/api-responses/crm-lead.json"), "utf-8"),
);

// Read a plain-text fixture
const emailBody = readFileSync(
  resolve(__dirname, "../../fixtures/emails/lead-inquiry.txt"),
  "utf-8",
);
```

If you prefer a helper that resolves from the repo root:

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import path from "node:path";

const repoRoot = path.resolve(path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)), "../..");

function readFixture(relativePath: string): string {
  return readFileSync(path.join(repoRoot, "fixtures", relativePath), "utf-8");
}

// Usage
const pricingHtml = readFixture("web-pages/pricing-page.html");
const contacts = readFixture("csv/contacts.csv");
```

## Guidelines

- **Fake data only.** Use `.example.com` domains, `555-xxx-xxxx` phone numbers, and fictional company names.
- **Keep fixtures self-contained.** Each file should be usable independently without external dependencies.
- **Add new fixtures freely.** Place them in the appropriate subdirectory and update this README.
- **Do not duplicate test/fixtures.** The existing `test/fixtures/` directory holds test-harness-specific fixtures (e.g., child process stubs). This top-level `fixtures/` directory is for shared, realistic sample data.
