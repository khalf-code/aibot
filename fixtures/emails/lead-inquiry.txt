Hi there,

My name is Jane Doe, and I'm the VP of Operations at Acme Corp. We're a
mid-sized manufacturing company with about 350 employees, headquartered
in Springfield, IL.

We've been evaluating messaging automation platforms and came across
OpenClaw. We're particularly interested in the following capabilities:

  - Multi-channel messaging (Slack, Teams, and email)
  - CRM integration with our existing Salesforce instance
  - Automated lead routing and follow-up sequences
  - Analytics and reporting dashboards

Our current contract with our existing provider expires at the end of Q1,
so we're looking to make a decision within the next 4-6 weeks.

Could you set up a demo call for our team? The best times are
Tuesday/Thursday afternoons (CST). The attendees would be:

  - Jane Doe (myself) — VP of Operations
  - Bob Smith — Director of Sales
  - Carol Johnson — IT Manager

Our estimated budget for this initiative is in the $25,000-$40,000/year
range. We'd also want to discuss volume pricing for additional seats.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
VP of Operations, Acme Corp
