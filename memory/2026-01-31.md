## UndercoverAgent.ai — MVP Complete 🕵️

**Live:** https://undercoveragent.vercel.app

### What's Working
- Landing page with "Undercover Andy" mascot (robot detective with brown fedora)
- Pricing section with 4 tiers (Observer free, Operative $99, Handler $499, Director custom)
- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages
- Waitlist with auto-reply email via PurelyMail SMTP
- Stripe checkout buttons working

### Stripe (WithCandor Account)
| Tier | Product ID | Price ID | Payment Link |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Operative | prod_TtUK8S7IlTSb8v | price_1SvhLdEJ7b5sfPTDFH7cd27R | https://buy.stripe.com/4gM7sL5E47Q4apn7AF2ZO02 |
| Handler | prod_TtUKAEmcfTcA17 | price_1SvhLjEJ7b5sfPTDR6yw6PiW | https://buy.stripe.com/cNi7sLaYo6M05531ch2ZO03 |

### Email Setup
- **Temporary:** undercoveragent@withagency.ai (credentials in 1Password)
- **Pending:** undercoveragent.ai domain verification in PurelyMail
  - DNS records configured correctly in Vercel
  - Ownership proof TXT record added
  - Waiting for David to verify in PurelyMail dashboard
  - Once verified: create hello@ and noreply@ accounts

### Waitlist Tech
- Uses nodemailer with PurelyMail SMTP
- Sends admin notification + user auto-reply
- Auto-reply written by Scribe: "You're on the list, Agent."
- **Gotcha:** Vercel env vars must not have trailing newlines (use `printf` not `<<<`)

## Agent Orchestration Formalized

### New Agents Created
- **⚙️ Ops** — DNS, email (PurelyMail), environment vars, infrastructure
- Improved **Builder**, **Sentinel**, **Payments** with detailed instructions

### Key Workflow: Builder → Sentinel (MANDATORY)
Every Builder task that touches UI must be followed by Sentinel QA:
1. Builder completes and pushes
2. Steve spawns Sentinel for QA
3. Sentinel reports issues → Builder fixes
4. Repeat until Sentinel approves

### Files Updated
- `/agents/PLAYBOOK.md` — Full incubation workflow with phases
- `/agents/ROSTER.md` — Added Ops agent
- `/agents/ops/AGENT.md` — New: infrastructure setup
- `/agents/builder/AGENT.md` — Detailed instructions, common mistakes
- `/agents/sentinel/AGENT.md` — QA methodology, output formats
- `/agents/payments/AGENT.md` — Stripe API workflow

## qmd Integration

- Local semantic search across 968+ session transcripts
- Use `qmd search -c sessions` for conversation history
- Built-in `memory_search` only searches memory files, not transcripts
- Updated TOOLS.md with guidance on when to use which

## OpenClaw Upstream Sync
