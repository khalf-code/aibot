# 2026-01-31 — Agent Console + UndercoverAgent.ai Launch

## Agent Console Refinements

- **UX Architect agent created** (`/agents/ux-architect/AGENT.md`) for design system cohesion
- UX audit completed: stripped Dashboard to stats + live activity feed only
- Each tab now has ONE clear purpose:
  - Dashboard: "What's happening now?" (stats + activity feed)
  - Agents: "Who can I deploy?" (roster + spawn)
  - Sessions: "What are they doing?" (conversations)
  - Tasks: "What needs to be done?" (Vikunja backlog)
- Added multi-project support: now tracks MeshGuard, SaveState, Agent Console, Inbox
- Fixed bottom nav spacing, label truncation, added Tasks to nav
- Live: https://dashboard.agentconsole.app

## New Idea Exploration

### Agent Optimized (NO-GO)
- Website grader for AI/LLM readiness (like HubSpot SEO grader)
- Scout research: 15+ competitors already, including HubSpot's free AEO Grader
- llms.txt adoption only 0.2%
- **Decision: NO-GO**

### AgentTest / AgentvAgent (Conditional)
- Pivot: AI agents that test websites
- Market crowded (Momentic $15M, Skyvern, etc.)
- **Niche opportunity: Agent-vs-Agent testing** (test AI chatbots WITH AI agents)

### UndercoverAgent.ai (GO) 🕵️
- **Final pivot**: Secret shopper for AI agents
- Like uTest but for AI - deploy agents to test company chatbots
- David loved this direction

## UndercoverAgent.ai — Foundation Phase

**Vikunja Project:** ID 9
**Domain:** undercoveragent.ai (purchased via Vercel)
**GitHub:** github.com/dbhurley/undercoveragent
**Live:** https://undercoveragent.vercel.app

### Completed:
- ✅ CONCEPT.md (full project spec)
- ✅ BRAND-GUIDE.md (logo concepts, colors, typography)
- ✅ Brand direction: **Light + Professional + Classified Briefing/Surveillance**
  - NOT dark moody spy noir
  - YES bright, clean, modern intelligence agency
  - Classified dossiers, redacted text, folder tabs
  - Colors: Cyan #00D4AA, Indigo #5B5FC7 on light backgrounds
- ✅ Custom assets generated via Nano Banana Pro:
  - hero-agent.png, dossier-bg.png, agent-mascot.png
  - dashboard-light.png, hero-friendly.png
- ✅ Bespoke landing page v2 with:
  - CLASSIFIED stamps, folder tabs, redacted hover-to-reveal
  - Typewriter animation, animated counters
  - Dossier-style cards, paper textures
- ✅ Bear notes synced

### Remaining Foundation:
- ⏳ Email setup (PurelyMail)
- ⏳ Social handles (@undercoveragent)

### Brand Guide v2 Created
- Analyzed actual logo (cute robot with fedora)
- Key colors extracted:
  - Agent Navy: #2C3E50
  - Detective Cyan: #5DADE2
  - Goldenrod Yellow: #F5B041
  - Fedora Brown: #8B5A2B
- Font: Nunito (friendly rounded, matches mascot personality)
- Saved to Bear with proper formatting
- Updated incubation checklist with branding sub-agent routine

## Sub-Agent System Fixed

**Problem:** `sessions_spawn` was returning "forbidden" - config setting got lost during upstream sync.

**Fix:** Added `subagents.allowAgents: ["*"]` to main agent in config.

**Prevention:** Created `scripts/validate-config.sh` that runs after upstream syncs to restore critical settings if lost.

## New Tools & Agents

### qmd Installed
- Local semantic search via `bun install -g github.com/tobi/qmd`
- Collections indexed: memory, workspace, sessions (968 transcripts!)
- Commands: `qmd search`, `qmd vsearch`, `qmd query`
- BM25 search works immediately; embeddings need `qmd embed` (takes ~1hr)

### Thinker Agent Created
- **Role:** Deep reasoning, complex analysis
- **Model:** `openai/codex` with `thinking: "medium"`
- **Location:** `/agents/thinker/AGENT.md`
- Use for architecture decisions, strategic analysis, debugging

## DBH Ventures File Storage

**Correct Dropbox path:** `/Users/steve/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/DBH-Ventures/`
(NOT `~/Dropbox` - that's a fake folder!)

**Structure:**
- MeshGuard/ — pitch-deck.pdf, pitch-deck.pptx, one-pager.pdf ✓
- SaveState/ — (needs decks)
- UndercoverAgent/ — (awaiting David's files)
- AgentConsole/ — (needs decks)

**Rule:** Dropbox = large files (PDFs, PPTXs). Bear = all markdown.

## David's Design Feedback (Important!)

> "I'm very disappointed with the quality of the design. This is the most boring template. Canvas has nano-banana-pro and incredible capabilities. Our startups should have bespoke design unlike any other. Instantly recognizable. Innovative, interactive, stunning graphics, unexpected surprise and delight."

**Lesson:** Never ship generic templates. Always bespoke, always stunning.

## Pending

- **Merge conflicts** from upstream sync need resolution:
  - AGENTS.md
  - pnpm-lock.yaml
  - src/infra/unhandled-rejections.ts

## Agent Roster Update

Added **🏗️ UX Architect** to roster:
- Role: Design system consistency, information architecture, UX cohesion
- Location: `/agents/ux-architect/AGENT.md`
- Label: `ux-architect`
