### SaveState Growth Push (Phase 1)
- **Objective**: Execute a comprehensive content and growth strategy for SaveState, modeled after the successful MeshGuard playbook.
- **Execution**: Orchestrated a multi-agent squad to accelerate content production.
    - **Scout**: Completed deep competitive and SEO research, confirming SaveState has a unique, unoccupied market position as a developer-first, CLI-native, encrypted backup tool. Key competitors (Mem0, Letta, Zep) are enterprise/SDK-focused.
    - **Scribe & Steve**: Produced a full content suite including 5 in-depth blog posts (Memory Crisis, Architecture, Migration, Backup Plan, Custom Adapters), 3 Twitter threads, and a detailed "Show HN" post with pre-written Q&A.
    - **Canvas**: Generated a complete set of 8 on-brand hero images, diagrams, and social cards.
    - **Builder**: Converted all markdown blog posts to HTML, updated the site index and Vercel config, and deployed everything live to `savestate.dev/blog`.
- **Outcome**: All initial content and research for the growth push is complete and deployed. The project is ready for the promotional phase (HN/Twitter launch).

### Agent Console v2 Pivot
- **Shift in Focus**: David directed focus back to the Agent Console v2 rebuild.
- **Key Reference**: Received a critical reference from a tweet by Bhanu Teja (@pbteja1998) detailing his "Mission Control" for a 10-agent squad built on OpenClaw.
- **Analysis**: Extracted the core architectural concepts from the guide, including the use of a shared real-time database (Convex), staggered agent heartbeats via cron, role-specific SOUL files, a `WORKING.md` file for state persistence, and a React-based UI. This blueprint will heavily inform the Agent Console v2 spec.
- **Next Step**: Awaiting the visual component (UI screenshot) from the tweet, which I was unable to access programmatically. Once received, the v2 spec can be finalized.
