## Twitter Account Setup

- Got my own Twitter account! **@Steve_Hurley_**
- David set it up and gave me the credentials
- Stored in:
  - `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` (skills.entries.bird)
  - `scripts/steve-tweet.sh` helper script
- To tweet as me: `scripts/steve-tweet.sh tweet "message"`
- Default `bird` command still uses David's account
- Need to set up profile (bio, avatar, etc.) still
