The deck is the Smith-Waite Centennial Tarot Deck (a faithful reproduction of the original [Rider-Waite-Smith deck](/wiki/Rider-Waite-Smith_deck) from 1909).\\nTarot (, first known as [trionfi](/wiki/Trionfi_(cards)) and later as tarocchi or tarocks) is a set of [playing cards](/wiki/Playing_cards) used in [tarot games](/wiki/Tarot_card_games) and in fortune-telling or divination. From at least the mid-15th century, the tarot was used to play trick-taking card games such as [Tarocchini](/wiki/Tarocchini). From their [Italian](/wiki/Italy) roots, tarot games spread to most of Europe, evolving into new forms including German [Grosstarok](/wiki/Grosstarok) and modern examples such as [French Tarot](/wiki/French_Tarot) and Austrian [Königrufen](/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen).\\n\\nTarot is commonly found in many countries, especially in English and Spanish speaking countries where tarot games are not as widely played, in the form of specially designed [cartomantic](/wiki/Cartomancy) decks used primarily for [tarot card reading](/wiki/Tarot_card_reading), in which each card corresponds to an assigned [archetype](/wiki/Archetype) or interpretation for [divination](/wiki/Divination), [fortune-telling](/wiki/Fortune-telling) or for other non-gaming uses.\\n\\nThe emergence of custom decks for use in [divination](/wiki/Divination) via [tarot card reading](/wiki/Tarot_card_reading) and [cartomancy](/wiki/Cartomancy) began after French [occultists](/wiki/Occultist) made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning in the late 18th century.[[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett1996ix-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2) Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the [Tarot de Marseille](/wiki/Tarot_de_Marseille) and the [Swiss 1JJ Tarot](/wiki/Swiss_1JJ_Tarot), originally intended for playing card games, are also used for cartomancy.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\\n\\nTarot has four [suits](/wiki/Suit_(cards)) that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten [pip cards](/wiki/Pip_(counting)) numbering from one (or [Ace](/wiki/Ace)) to ten; and four [face cards](/wiki/Face_card): [King](/wiki/King_(playing_card)), [Queen](/wiki/Queen_(playing_card)), [Knight](/wiki/Knight_(playing_card)), and [Jack/Knave/Page](/wiki/Jack_(playing_card)). In addition, the tarot also has a separate 21-card [trump](/wiki/Trump_(card_games)) suit and a single card known as [the Fool](/wiki/The_Fool_(tarot_card)). Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4) These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play [trick-taking card games](/wiki/Trick-taking_card_game).\\n\\nThe use of tarot for trick-taking games was at one time widespread across the whole of Europe except the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balkans.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Having fallen into decline by the 20th century, the games later experienced a renaissance in some countries and regions. For example, [French Tarot](/wiki/French_Tarot) was largely confined to [Provence](/wiki/Provence) in the 18th century, but took off in the 1950s to such an extent that, in 1973, the French Tarot Association (Fédération Française de Tarot) was formed and French Tarot itself is now the second most popular card game in France.[[6]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDaynes20006-6) Tarock games like [Königrufen](/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen) have experienced significant growth in Austria where international tournaments are held with other nations, especially those from eastern Europe that still play such games, including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7)\\n\\nDenmark appears to be the only Scandinavian country that still plays tarot games,[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) [Danish Tarok](/wiki/Danish_Tarok) being a derivative of historical German [Grosstarock](/wiki/Grosstarock). The game of [Cego](/wiki/Cego) has grown in popularity again in the south German region of Baden.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) Italy continues to play regionally popular games with their distinctive Tarot packs. These include: [Ottocento](/wiki/Ottocento_(card_game)) in [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna) and Sicilian Tarocchi in parts of [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily).[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) Meanwhile [Troccas](/wiki/Troccas) and [Troggu](/wiki/Troggu) are still played locally in parts of Switzerland.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7)\\n\\n### Playing cards and early tarot-like games\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tarot&action=edit&section=3)]\\n\\nTarot cards, then known as tarocchi (Italian), first appeared in [Ferrara](/wiki/Ferrara) and [Milan](/wiki/Milan) in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 trumps (then called [trionfi](/wiki/Trionfi_(cards))) being added to the standard Italian pack of four suits: [batons](/wiki/Batons_(suit)), [coins](/wiki/Coins_(suit)), [cups](/wiki/Cups_(suit)) and [swords](/wiki/Swords_(suit)).[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett199628,_31-8) Scholarship has established that early European playing cards were probably based on the [Egyptian Mamluk deck](/wiki/Playing_card#Egypt) invented in or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction of paper from Asia into Western Europe.[[9]](#cite_note-wopc-9) By the late 1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with variations to the [suit symbols](/wiki/Suit_symbol) and [court cards](/wiki/Court_card).[[9]](#cite_note-wopc-9)\\n\\nThe first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in [Bern](/wiki/Bern) and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of card games being banned.[[10]](#cite_note-10)[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12) Little is known about the appearance and number of these cards, the only significant information being provided by a text by [John of Rheinfelden](/wiki/John_of_Rheinfelden) in 1377 from [Freiburg im Breisgau](/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau), who, in addition to other versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the King, Ober and Unter (\\\"marshals\\\"), although Dames and Queens were already known by then.\\n\\nAn early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still used in traditional [Italian](/wiki/Italian_playing_cards), [Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_playing_cards) and Portuguese playing card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.[[13]](#cite_note-13)\\n\\nA lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke [Filippo Maria Visconti](/wiki/Filippo_Maria_Visconti) and described by Martiano da Tortona, probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he mentions, [Michelino da Besozzo](/wiki/Michelino_Molinari_da_Besozzo), returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [Roman gods](/wiki/List_of_Roman_deities) and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \\\"trumps\\\" since, in 1449, [Jacopo Antonio Marcello](/wiki/Jacopo_Antonio_Marcello) recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus, or \\\"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs.\\\"[[14]](#cite_note-14) Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [Sola-Busca](/wiki/Sola_Busca_tarot) and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\\n\\n/wiki/File:Bembo-Visconti-tarot-arcanum-01-magician.jpgThe juggler from the Pierpont Morgan Bergamo Visconti-Sforza pack [[15]](#cite_note-15)\\nThe first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in [Milan](/wiki/Milan), [Ferrara](/wiki/Ferrara), [Florence](/wiki/Florence) and [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna), when additional trump cards with [allegorical](/wiki/Allegorical) [illustrations](/wiki/Illustration) were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called carte da trionfi, triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [trionfi](/wiki/Trionfi_(cards)), which became \\\"trumps\\\" in English. The earliest documentation of trionfi is found in a written statement in the court records of [Florence](/wiki/Florence), in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta](/wiki/Sigismondo_Pandolfo_Malatesta).[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17)\\n\\nThe oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so decks of the [Visconti-Sforza Tarot](/wiki/Visconti-Sforza_Tarot) painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the [Duchy of Milan](/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan).[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett199625-18) In 15th century Italy, the set of cards that was included in tarot packs, including trumps, seems to have been consistent, even if naming and ordering varied. There are two main exceptions:[[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDummett198076-77-19)\\n\\n- Some late 15th-century decks like the [Sola Busca tarot](/wiki/Sola_Busca_tarot) and the Boiardo deck had four suits, a fool, and 21 trumps, but none of the trump images match the images normally used on Italian tarot cards. They seem to have been made on the model of tarot decks, but were voluntary departures from an established standard.\\n\\n- The Visconti di Mondrone pack, one of the Visconti-Sforza decks, originally had a Dame and a Maid in each suit, in addition to the standard King, Queen, Knight, and Jack. Additionally, the pack includes three trump cards which represent the [theological virtues](/wiki/Theological_virtues) of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are not present in any other tarot deck of that era.\\n\\nAlthough a [Dominican](/wiki/Dominican_Order) preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in playing cards, chiefly because of their use in gambling, in a sermon in the 15th century,[[20]](#cite_note-20) no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\\n\\n/wiki/File:Tarot-cary-collection-ita-sheet-3s-c1500..jpgThe Cary sheet, a partial uncut sheet of Milanese tarocchi, c. 1500\\nBecause the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the [printing press](/wiki/Printing_press) that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [Italian Wars](/wiki/Italian_Wars). The most prominent tarot deck version used in these two countries was the [Tarot of Marseilles](/wiki/Tarot_of_Marseilles), of Milanese origin.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\\n\\nWhile the set of trumps was generally consistent, their order varied by region, perhaps as early as the 1440s. [Michael Dummett](/wiki/Michael_Dummett) placed them into three categories. In [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna) and [Florence](/wiki/Florence), the highest trump is the [Angel](/wiki/Judgement_(Tarot_card)), followed by the [World](/wiki/The_World_(Tarot_card)).

From at least the mid-15th century, the tarot was used to play trick-taking card games such as [Tarocchini](/wiki/Tarocchini). From their [Italian](/wiki/Italy) roots, tarot games spread to most of Europe, evolving into new forms including German [Grosstarok](/wiki/Grosstarok) and modern examples such as [French Tarot](/wiki/French_Tarot) and Austrian [Königrufen](/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen).\n\nTarot is commonly found in many countries, especially in English and Spanish speaking countries where tarot games are not as widely played, in the form of specially designed [cartomantic](/wiki/Cartomancy) decks used primarily for [tarot card reading](/wiki/Tarot_card_reading), in which each card corresponds to an assigned [archetype](/wiki/Archetype) or interpretation for [divination](/wiki/Divination), [fortune-telling](/wiki/Fortune-telling) or for other non-gaming uses.\n\nThe emergence of custom decks for use in [divination](/wiki/Divination) via [tarot card reading](/wiki/Tarot_card_reading) and [cartomancy](/wiki/Cartomancy) began after French [occultists](/wiki/Occultist) made elaborate, but unsubstantiated, claims about their history and meaning in the late 18th century.[[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett1996ix-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2) Thus, there are two distinct types of tarot packs in circulation: those used for card games and those used for divination. However, some older patterns, such as the [Tarot de Marseille](/wiki/Tarot_de_Marseille) and the [Swiss 1JJ Tarot](/wiki/Swiss_1JJ_Tarot), originally intended for playing card games, are also used for cartomancy.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nTarot has four [suits](/wiki/Suit_(cards)) that vary by region: French suits are used in western, central and eastern Europe, and Latin suits in southern Europe. Each suit has 14 cards: ten [pip cards](/wiki/Pip_(counting)) numbering from one (or [Ace](/wiki/Ace)) to ten; and four [face cards](/wiki/Face_card): [King](/wiki/King_(playing_card)), [Queen](/wiki/Queen_(playing_card)), [Knight](/wiki/Knight_(playing_card)), and [Jack/Knave/Page](/wiki/Jack_(playing_card)). In addition, the tarot also has a separate 21-card [trump](/wiki/Trump_(card_games)) suit and a single card known as [the Fool](/wiki/The_Fool_(tarot_card)). Depending on the game, the Fool may act as the top trump or may be played to avoid following suit.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4) These tarot cards are still used throughout much of Europe to play [trick-taking card games](/wiki/Trick-taking_card_game).\n\nThe use of tarot for trick-taking games was at one time widespread across the whole of Europe except the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balkans.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Having fallen into decline by the 20th century, the games later experienced a renaissance in some countries and regions. For example, [French Tarot](/wiki/French_Tarot) was largely confined to [Provence](/wiki/Provence) in the 18th century, but took off in the 1950s to such an extent that, in 1973, the French Tarot Association (Fédération Française de Tarot) was formed and French Tarot itself is now the second most popular card game in France.[[6]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDaynes20006-6) Tarock games like [Königrufen](/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen) have experienced significant growth in Austria where international tournaments are held with other nations, especially those from eastern Europe that still play such games, including Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7)\n\nDenmark appears to be the only Scandinavian country that still plays tarot games,[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) [Danish Tarok](/wiki/Danish_Tarok) being a derivative of historical German [Grosstarock](/wiki/Grosstarock). The game of [Cego](/wiki/Cego) has grown in popularity again in the south German region of Baden.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) Italy continues to play regionally popular games with their distinctive Tarot packs. These include: [Ottocento](/wiki/Ottocento_(card_game)) in [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna) and Sicilian Tarocchi in parts of [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily).[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7) Meanwhile [Troccas](/wiki/Troccas) and [Troggu](/wiki/Troggu) are still played locally in parts of Switzerland.[[7]](#cite_note-pagatTG-7)\n\n### Playing cards and early tarot-like games\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tarot&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nTarot cards, then known as tarocchi (Italian), first appeared in [Ferrara](/wiki/Ferrara) and [Milan](/wiki/Milan) in northern Italy, with the Fool and 21 trumps (then called [trionfi](/wiki/Trionfi_(cards))) being added to the standard Italian pack of four suits: [batons](/wiki/Batons_(suit)), [coins](/wiki/Coins_(suit)), [cups](/wiki/Cups_(suit)) and [swords](/wiki/Swords_(suit)).[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett199628,_31-8) Scholarship has established that early European playing cards were probably based on the [Egyptian Mamluk deck](/wiki/Playing_card#Egypt) invented in or before the 14th century, which followed the introduction of paper from Asia into Western Europe.[[9]](#cite_note-wopc-9) By the late 1300s, Europeans were producing their own cards, the earliest patterns being based on the Mamluk deck but with variations to the [suit symbols](/wiki/Suit_symbol) and [court cards](/wiki/Court_card).[[9]](#cite_note-wopc-9)\n\nThe first records of playing cards in Europe date to 1367 in [Bern](/wiki/Bern) and they appear to have spread very rapidly across the whole of Europe, as may be seen from the records, mainly of card games being banned.[[10]](#cite_note-10)[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12) Little is known about the appearance and number of these cards, the only significant information being provided by a text by [John of Rheinfelden](/wiki/John_of_Rheinfelden) in 1377 from [Freiburg im Breisgau](/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau), who, in addition to other versions, describes the basic pack as containing the still-current 4 suits of 13 cards, the courts usually being the King, Ober and Unter (\"marshals\"), although Dames and Queens were already known by then.\n\nAn early pattern of playing cards used the suits of batons or clubs, coins, swords, and cups. These suits are still used in traditional [Italian](/wiki/Italian_playing_cards), [Spanish](/wiki/Spanish_playing_cards) and Portuguese playing card decks, and are also used in modern (occult) tarot divination cards that first appeared in the late 18th century.[[13]](#cite_note-13)\n\nA lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke [Filippo Maria Visconti](/wiki/Filippo_Maria_Visconti) and described by Martiano da Tortona, probably between 1418 and 1425 since the painter he mentions, [Michelino da Besozzo](/wiki/Michelino_Molinari_da_Besozzo), returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 60-card deck with 16 cards having images of the [Roman gods](/wiki/List_of_Roman_deities) and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as \"trumps\" since, in 1449, [Jacopo Antonio Marcello](/wiki/Jacopo_Antonio_Marcello) recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus, or \"a new and exquisite kind of triumphs.\"[[14]](#cite_note-14) Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the [Sola-Busca](/wiki/Sola_Busca_tarot) and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\n\n/wiki/File:Bembo-Visconti-tarot-arcanum-01-magician.jpgThe juggler from the Pierpont Morgan Bergamo Visconti-Sforza pack [[15]](#cite_note-15)\nThe first documented tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in [Milan](/wiki/Milan), [Ferrara](/wiki/Ferrara), [Florence](/wiki/Florence) and [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna), when additional trump cards with [allegorical](/wiki/Allegorical) [illustrations](/wiki/Illustration) were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called carte da trionfi, triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as [trionfi](/wiki/Trionfi_(cards)), which became \"trumps\" in English. The earliest documentation of trionfi is found in a written statement in the court records of [Florence](/wiki/Florence), in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to [Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta](/wiki/Sigismondo_Pandolfo_Malatesta).[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17)\n\nThe oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so decks of the [Visconti-Sforza Tarot](/wiki/Visconti-Sforza_Tarot) painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the [Duchy of Milan](/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan).[[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDeckerDepaulisDummett199625-18) In 15th century Italy, the set of cards that was included in tarot packs, including trumps, seems to have been consistent, even if naming and ordering varied. There are two main exceptions:[[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDummett198076-77-19)\n\n- Some late 15th-century decks like the [Sola Busca tarot](/wiki/Sola_Busca_tarot) and the Boiardo deck had four suits, a fool, and 21 trumps, but none of the trump images match the images normally used on Italian tarot cards. They seem to have been made on the model of tarot decks, but were voluntary departures from an established standard.\n\n- The Visconti di Mondrone pack, one of the Visconti-Sforza decks, originally had a Dame and a Maid in each suit, in addition to the standard King, Queen, Knight, and Jack. Additionally, the pack includes three trump cards which represent the [theological virtues](/wiki/Theological_virtues) of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and are not present in any other tarot deck of that era.\n\nAlthough a [Dominican](/wiki/Dominican_Order) preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in playing cards, chiefly because of their use in gambling, in a sermon in the 15th century,[[20]](#cite_note-20) no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\n\n/wiki/File:Tarot-cary-collection-ita-sheet-3s-c1500..jpgThe Cary sheet, a partial uncut sheet of Milanese tarocchi, c. 1500\nBecause the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the [printing press](/wiki/Printing_press) that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the [Italian Wars](/wiki/Italian_Wars). The most prominent tarot deck version used in these two countries was the [Tarot of Marseilles](/wiki/Tarot_of_Marseilles), of Milanese origin.[[4]](#cite_note-DummettGame-4)\n\nWhile the set of trumps was generally consistent, their order varied by region, perhaps as early as the 1440s. [Michael Dummett](/wiki/Michael_Dummett) placed them into three categories. In [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna) and [Florence](/wiki/Florence), the highest trump is the [Angel](/wiki/Judgement_(Tarot_card)), followed by the [World](/wiki/The_World_(Tarot_card)). This group spread mainly southward through the [Papal States](/wiki/Papal_States), the [Kingdom of Naples](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples), and finally down to the [Kingdom of Sicily](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily) but was also known in the [Savoyard states](/wiki/Savoyard_state). In Ferrara, the World was the highest, followed by [Justice](/wiki/Justice_(Tarot_card)) and the Angel. This group spread mainly to the northeast to Venice and [Trento](/wiki/Prince-Bishopric_of_Trent) where it was only a passing fad. By the end of the 16th century, this order became extinct. In [Milan](/wiki/Milan), the World was highest, followed by the Angel; this ordering is used in the Tarot of Marseilles. Dummett also wrote about a possible fourth lineage that may have existed along the Franco-Italian border. It spread north through France until its last descendant, the [Belgian Tarot](/wiki/Belgian_Tarot), went extinct around 1800.[[21]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDummett1980387–417-21)[[22]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDummettMcLeod200413–16-22)\n\nIn Florence, an expanded deck called [Minchiate](/wiki/Minchiate) was later used.

It is historically based on [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy)'s [Tetrabiblos](/wiki/Tetrabiblos) (2nd century CE), which in turn was a continuation of [Hellenistic](/wiki/Hellenistic_astrology) and ultimately [Babylonian](/wiki/Babylonian_astrology) traditions.\\n\\nWestern astrology is largely [horoscopic](/wiki/Horoscopic_astrology), that is, it is a form of [divination](/wiki/Divination) based on the construction of a [horoscope](/wiki/Horoscope) for an exact moment, such as a person's birth as well as location (since time zones may or may not affect a person's birth chart), in which various cosmic bodies are said to have an influence. Astrology in western [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture) is often reduced to [sun sign astrology](/wiki/Sun_sign_astrology), which considers only the individual's date of birth (i.e. the \\\"position of the Sun\\\" at that date).\\n\\nAstrology is a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience) and has consistently failed experimental and theoretical verification.[[1]](#cite_note-SvenOve-1)[[2]](#cite_note-ASotP-2)[[3]](#cite_note-Vishveshwara-3)\\n\\nAstrology was widely considered a respectable academic and scientific field before [the Enlightenment](/wiki/The_Enlightenment), but modern research has found no consistent [empirical](/wiki/Empirical) basis to it.[[4]](#cite_note-Kassell-4)[[3]](#cite_note-Vishveshwara-3)\\n\\nA central principle of astrology is integration within the cosmos. The individual, Earth, and its environment are viewed [as a single organism](/wiki/Organicism), all parts of which are correlated with each other.[[a]](#cite_note-6) Cycles of change that are observed in the heavens are therefore reflective (not causative) of similar cycles of change observed on earth and within the individual.[[b]](#cite_note-7) This relationship is expressed in the [Hermetic](/wiki/Hermeticism) maxim \\\"as above, so below; as below, so above\\\", which postulates symmetry between the individual as a [microcosm](/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm) and the celestial environment as a macrocosm.[[c]](#cite_note-9)\\n\\nAs opposed to Sidereal astrology, Western astrology evaluates a person's birth based on the alignments of the stars and planets from the perspective on earth instead of in space.\\n\\nAt the heart of astrology is the [metaphysical](/wiki/Metaphysics) principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or 'tones' of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. An early example is Ptolemy, who wrote influential texts on all these topics.[[7]](#cite_note-10) [Al-Kindi](/wiki/Al-Kindi), in the 9th century, developed Ptolemy's ideas in De Aspectibus which explores many points of relevance to astrology and the use of planetary aspects.[[8]](#cite_note-11)[[9]](#cite_note-12)\\n\\nThe zodiac is the belt or band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move on their journey across the sky. Astrologers noted these constellations and so attached a particular significance to them. Over time they developed the system of twelve [signs](/wiki/Astrological_sign) of the zodiac, based on twelve of the constellations through which the sun passes throughout the year, those constellations that are \\\"Enlightened by the mind\\\". Most western astrologers use the [tropical zodiac](/wiki/Tropical_zodiac) beginning with the sign of [Aries](/wiki/Aries_(astrology)) at the [Northern Hemisphere](/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere) [vernal equinox](/wiki/Vernal_equinox_(northern_hemisphere)) always on or around March 21 of each year. The Western Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's relationship to fixed, designated positions in the sky, and the Earth's seasons. The Sidereal Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's position in relation to the constellations, and follows their movements in the sky.\\n\\nDue to a phenomenon called [precession of the equinoxes](/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes) (where the Earth's axis slowly rotates like a spinning top in a 25,700-year cycle), there is a slow shift in the correspondence between Earth's seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with the position of the earth in relation to fixed positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).[[10]](#cite_note-13)\\n\\nIn modern Western astrology the [signs](/wiki/Sign) of the [zodiac](/wiki/Zodiac) are believed to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve signs are divided into four elements [fire](/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)), [earth](/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)), [air](/wiki/Air_(classical_element)) and [water](/wiki/Water_(classical_element)). Fire and air signs are considered masculine, while water and earth signs are considered feminine.[[11]](#cite_note-:0-14) The twelve signs are also divided into three qualities, also called modalities, [Cardinal](/wiki/Cardinal_sign_(astrology)), [fixed](/wiki/Fixed_sign) and [mutable](/wiki/Mutable_sign).[[12]](#cite_note-:1-15)[[13]](#cite_note-:2-16)\\n\\nWestern Astrology

It is historically based on [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy)'s [Tetrabiblos](/wiki/Tetrabiblos) (2nd century CE), which in turn was a continuation of [Hellenistic](/wiki/Hellenistic_astrology) and ultimately [Babylonian](/wiki/Babylonian_astrology) traditions.\n\nWestern astrology is largely [horoscopic](/wiki/Horoscopic_astrology), that is, it is a form of [divination](/wiki/Divination) based on the construction of a [horoscope](/wiki/Horoscope) for an exact moment, such as a person's birth as well as location (since time zones may or may not affect a person's birth chart), in which various cosmic bodies are said to have an influence. Astrology in western [popular culture](/wiki/Popular_culture) is often reduced to [sun sign astrology](/wiki/Sun_sign_astrology), which considers only the individual's date of birth (i.e. the \"position of the Sun\" at that date).\n\nAstrology is a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience) and has consistently failed experimental and theoretical verification.[[1]](#cite_note-SvenOve-1)[[2]](#cite_note-ASotP-2)[[3]](#cite_note-Vishveshwara-3)\n\nAstrology was widely considered a respectable academic and scientific field before [the Enlightenment](/wiki/The_Enlightenment), but modern research has found no consistent [empirical](/wiki/Empirical) basis to it.[[4]](#cite_note-Kassell-4)[[3]](#cite_note-Vishveshwara-3)\n\nA central principle of astrology is integration within the cosmos. The individual, Earth, and its environment are viewed [as a single organism](/wiki/Organicism), all parts of which are correlated with each other.[[a]](#cite_note-6) Cycles of change that are observed in the heavens are therefore reflective (not causative) of similar cycles of change observed on earth and within the individual.[[b]](#cite_note-7) This relationship is expressed in the [Hermetic](/wiki/Hermeticism) maxim \"as above, so below; as below, so above\", which postulates symmetry between the individual as a [microcosm](/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm) and the celestial environment as a macrocosm.[[c]](#cite_note-9)\n\nAs opposed to Sidereal astrology, Western astrology evaluates a person's birth based on the alignments of the stars and planets from the perspective on earth instead of in space.\n\nAt the heart of astrology is the [metaphysical](/wiki/Metaphysics) principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or 'tones' of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. An early example is Ptolemy, who wrote influential texts on all these topics.[[7]](#cite_note-10) [Al-Kindi](/wiki/Al-Kindi), in the 9th century, developed Ptolemy's ideas in De Aspectibus which explores many points of relevance to astrology and the use of planetary aspects.[[8]](#cite_note-11)[[9]](#cite_note-12)\n\nThe zodiac is the belt or band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets move on their journey across the sky. Astrologers noted these constellations and so attached a particular significance to them. Over time they developed the system of twelve [signs](/wiki/Astrological_sign) of the zodiac, based on twelve of the constellations through which the sun passes throughout the year, those constellations that are \"Enlightened by the mind\". Most western astrologers use the [tropical zodiac](/wiki/Tropical_zodiac) beginning with the sign of [Aries](/wiki/Aries_(astrology)) at the [Northern Hemisphere](/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere) [vernal equinox](/wiki/Vernal_equinox_(northern_hemisphere)) always on or around March 21 of each year. The Western Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's relationship to fixed, designated positions in the sky, and the Earth's seasons. The Sidereal Zodiac is drawn based on the Earth's position in relation to the constellations, and follows their movements in the sky.\n\nDue to a phenomenon called [precession of the equinoxes](/wiki/Precession_of_the_equinoxes) (where the Earth's axis slowly rotates like a spinning top in a 25,700-year cycle), there is a slow shift in the correspondence between Earth's seasons (and calendar) and the constellations of the zodiac. Thus, the tropical zodiac corresponds with the position of the earth in relation to fixed positions in the sky (Western Astrology), while the sidereal zodiac is drawn based on the position in relation to the constellations (sidereal zodiac).[[10]](#cite_note-13)\n\nIn modern Western astrology the [signs](/wiki/Sign) of the [zodiac](/wiki/Zodiac) are believed to represent twelve basic personality types or characteristic modes of expression. The twelve signs are divided into four elements [fire](/wiki/Fire_(classical_element)), [earth](/wiki/Earth_(classical_element)), [air](/wiki/Air_(classical_element)) and [water](/wiki/Water_(classical_element)). Fire and air signs are considered masculine, while water and earth signs are considered feminine.[[11]](#cite_note-:0-14) The twelve signs are also divided into three qualities, also called modalities, [Cardinal](/wiki/Cardinal_sign_(astrology)), [fixed](/wiki/Fixed_sign) and [mutable](/wiki/Mutable_sign).[[12]](#cite_note-:1-15)[[13]](#cite_note-:2-16)\n\nWestern Astrology

In [Hindu culture](/wiki/Hindu_culture), newborns are traditionally named based on their jyotiṣa charts ([kundali](/wiki/Kundali_(astrology))), and astrological concepts are pervasive in the organization of the [Hindu calendar](/wiki/Hindu_calendar) and holidays and in making major decisions such as those about marriage, opening a new business, or moving into a new home. Many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the \\\"fruit of [karma](/wiki/Karma_in_Hinduism)\\\". The [Navagraha](/wiki/Navagraha), planetary deities, are considered subordinate to [Ishvara](/wiki/Ishvara) (the Hindu concept of a supreme being) in the administration of justice. Thus, it is believed that these planets can influence earthly life.[[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeyesDaniel1983[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid49GVZGD8d4oCdqshanikarmapgPA132_132]-23)\\n\\n### Astrology as a science\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hindu_astrology&action=edit&section=4)]\\n\\nThe scientific community has rejected astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. [Scientific testing](/wiki/Astrology#Scientific_appraisal) of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2009Zarka2011424-8) There is no mechanism proposed by astrologers through which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth. In spite of its status as a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), in certain religious, political, and legal contexts, astrology retains a position among the [sciences](/wiki/Science) in modern [India](/wiki/India).[[24]](#cite_note-24)\\n\\nIndia's [University Grants Commission](/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)) and [Ministry of Human Resource Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_Human_Resource_Development) decided to introduce \\\"Jyotir Vigyan\\\" (i.e. jyotir vijñāna) or \\\"Vedic astrology\\\" as a discipline of study in Indian universities, stating that \\\"vedic astrology is not only one of the main subjects of our traditional and classical knowledge but this is the discipline, which lets us know the events happening in human life and in universe on time scale\\\"[[25]](#cite_note-Times_of_India-2001-25) in spite of the complete lack of evidence that astrology actually does allow for such accurate predictions.[[26]](#cite_note-26) The decision was backed by a 2001 judgment of the [Andhra Pradesh High Court](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh_High_Court), and some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology.[[27]](#cite_note-27)[[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJayaraman2001-28)\\nThis was met with widespread protests from the scientific community in India and Indian scientists working abroad.[[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJayaraman2001-28) A petition sent to the [Supreme Court of India](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) stated that the introduction of astrology to university curricula is \\\"a giant leap backwards, undermining whatever scientific credibility the country has achieved so far\\\".[[25]](#cite_note-Times_of_India-2001-25)\\n\\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition,[[29]](#cite_note-29)[[30]](#cite_note-30) concluding that the teaching of astrology did not qualify as the promotion of religion.[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-The_Hindu-2004-32) In February 2011, the Bombay High Court referred to the 2004 Supreme Court ruling when it dismissed a case which had challenged astrology's status as a science.[[33]](#cite_note-33) As of 2014, despite continuing complaints by scientists,[[34]](#cite_note-34)[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35) astrology continues to be taught at various universities in India,[[32]](#cite_note-The_Hindu-2004-32)[[36]](#cite_note-36) and there is a movement in progress to establish a national Vedic University to teach astrology together with the study of [tantra](/wiki/Tantra), [mantra](/wiki/Mantra), and [yoga](/wiki/Yoga).[[37]](#cite_note-37)\\n\\nSkeptics have thoroughly debunked the claims made by Indian astrologers.. For example, although the planet Saturn is in the constellation [Aries](/wiki/Aries_(constellation)) roughly every 30 years (e.g. 1909, 1939, 1968), the astrologer [Bangalore Venkata Raman](/wiki/Bangalore_Venkata_Raman) claimed that \\\"when Saturn was in Aries in 1939 England had to declare war against Germany\\\", ignoring all the other dates.[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35) Astrologers regularly fail in attempts to predict election results in India, and fail to predict major events such as the assassination of [Indira Gandhi](/wiki/Indira_Gandhi). Predictions by the head of the Indian Astrologers Federation about war between India and Pakistan in 1982 also failed.[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35)\\n\\nIn 2000, when several planets happened to be close to one another, astrologers predicted that there would be catastrophes, [volcanic eruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_eruption) and [tidal waves](/wiki/Tsunami).

The Horāshastra is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the late 8th century.[[21]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPingree1981-21) The Sārāvalī likewise dates to around 800 CE.[[22]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPingree1981b81-22) N. N. Krishna Rau and V. B. Choudhari published English translations of these texts in 1963 and 1961, respectively.\n\n## Modern Hindu astrology\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hindu_astrology&action=edit&section=3)]\n\n/wiki/File:Ngram_of_Hindu_Vedic_Indian_Astrology.pngNomenclature of the last two centuries\n[Astrology](/wiki/Astrology) remains an important facet of [folk belief](/wiki/Folk_belief) in the contemporary lives of many [Hindus](/wiki/Hindu). In [Hindu culture](/wiki/Hindu_culture), newborns are traditionally named based on their jyotiṣa charts ([kundali](/wiki/Kundali_(astrology))), and astrological concepts are pervasive in the organization of the [Hindu calendar](/wiki/Hindu_calendar) and holidays and in making major decisions such as those about marriage, opening a new business, or moving into a new home. Many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the \"fruit of [karma](/wiki/Karma_in_Hinduism)\". The [Navagraha](/wiki/Navagraha), planetary deities, are considered subordinate to [Ishvara](/wiki/Ishvara) (the Hindu concept of a supreme being) in the administration of justice. Thus, it is believed that these planets can influence earthly life.[[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeyesDaniel1983[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid49GVZGD8d4oCdqshanikarmapgPA132_132]-23)\n\n### Astrology as a science\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hindu_astrology&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nThe scientific community has rejected astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. [Scientific testing](/wiki/Astrology#Scientific_appraisal) of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions.[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2009Zarka2011424-8) There is no mechanism proposed by astrologers through which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth. In spite of its status as a [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), in certain religious, political, and legal contexts, astrology retains a position among the [sciences](/wiki/Science) in modern [India](/wiki/India).[[24]](#cite_note-24)\n\nIndia's [University Grants Commission](/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)) and [Ministry of Human Resource Development](/wiki/Ministry_of_Human_Resource_Development) decided to introduce \"Jyotir Vigyan\" (i.e. jyotir vijñāna) or \"Vedic astrology\" as a discipline of study in Indian universities, stating that \"vedic astrology is not only one of the main subjects of our traditional and classical knowledge but this is the discipline, which lets us know the events happening in human life and in universe on time scale\"[[25]](#cite_note-Times_of_India-2001-25) in spite of the complete lack of evidence that astrology actually does allow for such accurate predictions.[[26]](#cite_note-26) The decision was backed by a 2001 judgment of the [Andhra Pradesh High Court](/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh_High_Court), and some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology.[[27]](#cite_note-27)[[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJayaraman2001-28)\nThis was met with widespread protests from the scientific community in India and Indian scientists working abroad.[[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJayaraman2001-28) A petition sent to the [Supreme Court of India](/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India) stated that the introduction of astrology to university curricula is \"a giant leap backwards, undermining whatever scientific credibility the country has achieved so far\".[[25]](#cite_note-Times_of_India-2001-25)\n\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition,[[29]](#cite_note-29)[[30]](#cite_note-30) concluding that the teaching of astrology did not qualify as the promotion of religion.[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-The_Hindu-2004-32) In February 2011, the Bombay High Court referred to the 2004 Supreme Court ruling when it dismissed a case which had challenged astrology's status as a science.[[33]](#cite_note-33) As of 2014, despite continuing complaints by scientists,[[34]](#cite_note-34)[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35) astrology continues to be taught at various universities in India,[[32]](#cite_note-The_Hindu-2004-32)[[36]](#cite_note-36) and there is a movement in progress to establish a national Vedic University to teach astrology together with the study of [tantra](/wiki/Tantra), [mantra](/wiki/Mantra), and [yoga](/wiki/Yoga).[[37]](#cite_note-37)\n\nSkeptics have thoroughly debunked the claims made by Indian astrologers.. For example, although the planet Saturn is in the constellation [Aries](/wiki/Aries_(constellation)) roughly every 30 years (e.g. 1909, 1939, 1968), the astrologer [Bangalore Venkata Raman](/wiki/Bangalore_Venkata_Raman) claimed that \"when Saturn was in Aries in 1939 England had to declare war against Germany\", ignoring all the other dates.[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35) Astrologers regularly fail in attempts to predict election results in India, and fail to predict major events such as the assassination of [Indira Gandhi](/wiki/Indira_Gandhi). Predictions by the head of the Indian Astrologers Federation about war between India and Pakistan in 1982 also failed.[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2013-35)\n\nIn 2000, when several planets happened to be close to one another, astrologers predicted that there would be catastrophes, [volcanic eruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_eruption) and [tidal waves](/wiki/Tsunami). This caused an entire sea-side village in the Indian state of [Gujarat](/wiki/Gujarat) to panic and abandon their houses. The predicted events did not occur and the vacant houses were burgled.[[38]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENarlikar2009-38)\n\nTime keeping\n\n[The current year] minus one,\n\nmultiplied by twelve,\n\nmultiplied by two,\n\nadded to the elapsed [half months of current year],\n\nincreased by two for every sixty [in the sun],\n\nis the quantity of half-months ([syzygies](/wiki/Syzygy_(astronomy))).\n\n— Rigveda Jyotisha-vedanga 4\nTranslator: Kim Plofker[[39]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker200936-39)\n\nThe ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the [Vedanga-Jyotisha](/wiki/Vedanga_Jyotisha), which exists in two editions, one linked to the [Rigveda](/wiki/Rigveda) and other to [Yajurveda](/wiki/Yajurveda).[[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOhashi1999719-40) The Rigveda version consists of 36 verses, while the Yajurveda recension has 43 verses of which 29 verses are borrowed from the Rigveda.[[41]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker200935–36-41)[[42]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPingree19731-42) The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha and sometimes to sage Shuci.[[42]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPingree19731-42) The Yajurveda version does not attribute credit to any specific sage, has endured into the modern era with a commentary by Somakara, and is considered the more studied version.\n\nThe Jyotisha text Brahma-siddhanta, probably composed in the 5th century CE, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar.[[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker200967–68-43) This text also lists [trigonometry](/wiki/Trigonometry) and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbits, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides.[[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker200967–68-43) The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as the lifetime of the current universe being 4.32 billion years.[[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker200968–71-44)\n\nThe ancient Hindu texts on Jyotisha only discuss timekeeping and never mention astrology or prophecy.[[45]](#cite_note-45) These ancient texts predominantly cover astronomy, but at a rudimentary level.[[46]](#cite_note-46) Technical horoscopes and astrology ideas in India came from Greece and developed in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE.[[47]](#cite_note-47)[[48]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOhashi1999719–721-48)[[49]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPingree19732–3-49) Later medieval era texts such as the Yavana-jataka and the [Siddhanta](/wiki/Siddhanta_(astronomy)) texts are more astrology-related.[[50]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlofker2009116–120,_259–261-50)\n\n## Evolution of Vedic timekeeping\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Hindu_astrology&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nThe field of Jyotisha deals with ascertaining time, particularly forecasting auspicious days and times for Vedic rituals.[[9]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELochtefeld2002-9) The field of Vedanga structured time into Yuga, which was "},"isError":false,"timestamp":1769362028932}}

Signs = qualities; Houses = life areas; Aspects = relationships\n\n**Key Components:**\n- **12 Zodiac Signs:** Personality archetypes grouped by element (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and modality (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable)\n- **Planets:** Sun (identity), Moon (emotions), Mercury (communication), Venus (values/relationships), Mars (action), Jupiter (expansion), Saturn (structure), Uranus (innovation), Neptune (idealism), Pluto (transformation)\n- **12 Houses:** Life areas (1: Self, 2: Resources, 3: Communication, 4: Home/Family, 5: Creativity, 6: Work/Health, 7: Partnerships, 8: Shared Resources/Intimacy, 9: Higher Learning/Travel, 10: Career/Public Status, 11: Community/Goals, 12: Unconscious/Spirituality)\n- **Aspects:** Angular relationships (conjunction, square, opposition, trine, sextile) describing planetary dynamics\n- **Transits:** Current planetary positions activating natal chart patterns\n\n### Vedic (Jyotish) Astrology: The Sidereal Tradition\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Vedic Period (1500-500 BCE):** Jyotisha emerges as Vedanga (auxiliary Vedic discipline)\n- **Ancient Texts:** Vedanga Jyotisha (astronomical timekeeping for rituals)\n- **Hellenistic Influence (2nd-4th century CE):** Yavanajataka - Greek astrology translated to Sanskrit\n- **Classical Period (5th-8th century CE):** Brihat Parashara Horashastra, Saravali - foundational texts\n- **Medieval Period:** Diverse schools, commentaries, regional traditions\n- **Modern Era:** Global spread through diaspora, digital platforms, cross-cultural exchange\n\n**Core Principles:**\n- **Sidereal Zodiac:** Based on actual constellations; uses ayanamsa correction (~24° shift from tropical)\n- **Karma & Destiny:** Charts reveal karmic patterns and potential life trajectory\n- **Nakshatras (27 Lunar Mansions):** Moon's 27-day cycle through constellations; deeper psychological and spiritual insights\n- **Dasha System:** Planetary periods determining timing of life events\n- **Yogas:** Planetary combinations creating specific outcomes\n- **Remedies:** Gemstones, mantras, rituals to balance planetary influences\n\n**Key Components:**\n- **12 Rashis (Signs):** Similar to Western signs with different emphasis\n- **27 Nakshatras:** Each 13°20' of zodiac; ruled by planets, deities, with specific qualities\n- **9 Grahas (Planets):** Sun (Surya), Moon (Chandra), Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Guru), Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), Rahu (North Node), Ketu (South Node)\n- **12 Bhavas (Houses):** Life areas with different interpretation than Western\n- **Vargas (Divisional Charts):** Specialized charts for specific life areas (e.g., Navamsa for relationships)\n- **Dashas:** Vimshottari Dasha (120-year cycle) most common; each planet rules specific years\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences: Western vs. Vedic Astrology\n\n| Aspect | Western Astrology | Vedic (Jyotish) Astrology |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Zodiac** | Tropical (season-based) | Sidereal (star-based) |\n| **Starting Point** | Spring equinox (Aries 0°) | Fixed star reference; ~24° shift (ayanamsa) |\n| **Focus** | Psychological patterns, personality | Karma, destiny, spiritual evolution |\n| **Prediction** | Transits, progressions, solar arcs | Dashas (planetary periods), transits |\n| **Lunar System** | Moon sign & phase | 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions) |\n| **Houses** | Equal house, Placidus, Koch, etc. | Whole sign houses (most common) |\n| **Planets** | Includes Uranus, Neptune, Pluto | Traditional 7 planets + Rahu/Ketu |\n| **Divisional Charts** | Rarely used | Vargas essential (Navamsa, Dashamsa, etc.) |\n| **Remedies** | Psychological work, awareness | Gemstones, mantras, rituals, puja |\n| **Philosophy** | Self-actualization, psychological integration | Dharma, karma, spiritual liberation |\n\n### The Ayanamsa Difference\n\n- **Precession of Equinoxes:** Earth's axis rotates 25,700-year cycle, creating ~1° every 72 years shift\n- **Current Difference:** ~24° between tropical and sidereal zodiac (varies by ayanamsa calculation)\n- **Practical Impact:** A person with Sun at 15° Leo in Western astrology likely has Sun in Cancer in Vedic\n- **Multiple Ayanamsas:** Lahiri (most common), Raman, Fagan-Bradley, Krishnamurti\n\n### Nakshatras vs. Zodiac Signs\n\n**Western Signs (12):**\n- Each spans 30°\n- Broad personality archetypes\n- Element and modality classification\n\n**Vedic Nakshatras (27):**\n- Each spans 13°20' (27 × 13°20' = 360°)\n- Deeper psychological and spiritual dimensions\n- Each ruled by specific planet and deity\n- Used for compatibility, timing, psychological profiling\n- Example: Moon in Bharani (first nakshatra) has different qualities than Moon in Krittika\n\n### Example: Same Birth, Different Readings\n\n**Birth:** August 15, 1990, 3:00 PM, New York City\n\n**Western Reading:**\n- Sun: 22° Leo (creative self-expression, leadership)\n- Moon: 2° Scorpio (emotional depth, intensity)\n- Rising: 22° Sagittarius (expansive, philosophical)\n- Focus: Personality dynamics, psychological patterns\n\n**Vedic Reading:**\n- Sun: 28° Cancer (Leo sidereal) - Cancer sign\n- Moon: 11° Libra (Scorpio sidereal) - Libra sign\n- Rising: 28° Scorpio (Sagittarius sidereal) - Scorpio sign\n- Nakshatra: Moon in Swati (ruled by Rahu)\n- Dasha: Current planetary period influences\n- Focus: Life path, karma, spiritual lessons, timing\n\n---\n\n## Modern Applications\n\n### Personal & Therapeutic\n\n**1.
