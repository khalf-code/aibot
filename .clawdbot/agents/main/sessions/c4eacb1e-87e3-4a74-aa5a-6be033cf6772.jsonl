Currently awaiting Simon's Instagram Basic Display API access token. Once deployed, will provide automated monitoring of @cerafica_design for new posts, sales announcements, and show dates.\n- **Impact:** High - Proactive business intelligence for Simon's ceramics business\n- **Solution:** Simon obtains API token → Install scripts to system PATH → Set up cron job → Create Slack alerting\n- **Status:** pending (postponed by Simon)\n\n### [2026-01-25-007] Low-Friction Capture Methods\n- **Proposed by:** Liam\n- **Date:** 2026-01-25\n- **Category:** tools\n- **Target file:** New capabilities\n- **Description:** NeuroSecond requires <2 second capture. Voice capture (pending Whisper.cpp) is primary. Need additional methods: Slack quick-capture command (`/note <text>`), mobile-friendly web form, email-to-capture (clawdbot@puenteworks.com). Multiple capture methods ensure friction-free thought capture.\n- **Impact:** High - Critical for NeuroSecond methodology\n- **Solution:** Create Slack slash command, build simple web form, set up email parsing\n- **Status:** pending\n\n### [2026-01-25-010] Automated Summarization for NeuroSecond \"Distill\"\n- **Proposed by:** Liam\n- **Date:** 2026-01-25\n- **Category:** tools\n- **Target file:** New capability\n- **Description:** NeuroSecond \"Distill\" stage needs: on-demand note summarization, automatic action item extraction, connection finding between notes, weekly review generation. Should leverage AI to surface insights and reduce cognitive load.\n- **Impact:** Medium - Reduces manual review burden\n- **Solution:** Build summarization pipeline, action item extraction, connection detection, weekly review generator\n- **Status:** pending\n\n### [2026-01-25-011] Notion Skill for PARA Database Integration\n- **Proposed by:** Liam\n- **Date:** 2026-01-25\n- **Category:** tools\n- **Target file:** New skill (notion)\n- **Description:** Notion skill exists at ~/clawdbot/skills/notion/SKILL.md but not yet integrated. PARA system could benefit from Notion database integration for projects, areas, resources, archives.

Every overnight project should include test.sh script. Need automated testing before delivery to Simon, with test coverage reports. Ensures quality and reduces broken deliveries.\n- **Impact:** Medium - Improves overnight build reliability\n- **Solution:** Add test.sh to all templates, automated testing pipeline, coverage reports\n- **Status:** pending\n\n## Approved\n\n### [2026-01-25-002] Whisper.cpp Installation for Voice Capture\n- **Proposed by:** Liam\n- **Date:** 2026-01-25\n- **Category:** tools\n- **Target file:** New skill installation\n- **Description:** Voice Wake marked PENDING in STATUS.md. Low-friction voice capture is critical for NeuroSecond methodology - need <2 second capture speed for thoughts and ideas.
