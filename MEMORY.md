# OpenClaw Memory (User)

## Preferences
- Primary communication: Discord DM.
- Timezone: America/New_York.
- Security posture: prefer safe defaults; do not suggest disabling allowInsecureAuth unless asked (currently intentional true).

## Current focus
- Keep OpenClaw running continuously with clear status updates to Discord.
- Improve comms/voice/visual readiness, but avoid unsafe autonomy.
